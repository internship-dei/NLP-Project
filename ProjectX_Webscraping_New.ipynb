File\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit: \\nAP\\n  A senior member of the International Olympic Committee has said he “can\\'t be certain” the postponed Tokyo Olympics will open in just over six months because of the surging pandemic in Japan and elsewhere.The comments by Canadian IOC member Richard Pound to British broadcaster the BBC came as Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a state of emergency on Thursday for Tokyo and surrounding prefectures.“I can\\'t be certain because the ongoing elephant in the room would be the surges in the virus,“ Pound said speaking about the future of the Tokyo Games.Japan\\'s emergency order, which is largely voluntary, will be in force until the first week of February.Tokyo reported a record of 2,447 new cases on Thursday, a 50% increase from the previous day — which was also a record day. Japan has attributed over 3,500 deaths to COVID-19, relatively low for a country of 126 million.Also read | Japan declares state of emergency in Tokyo areaIt\\'s crunch time for Tokyo. Organizers say the Olympics will take place, but they are not expected to reveal concrete plans until spring. That\\'s about the same time the torch relay begins on March 25 with 10,000 runners crisscrossing the country for four months leading to the opening ceremony on July 23.Pound also hinted athletes should be a high priority for a vaccine because they serve as “role models.” Pound\\'s comments seem to contradict IOC President Thomas Bach.Bach said in a visit to Tokyo in November that athletes should be encouraged to get a vaccine, but would not be required to. He also indicated they should not be a priority. Bach said that nurses, doctors and health care workers should be first in line for a vaccine, ahead of healthy, young athletes.“Athletes are important role models, and by taking the vaccine they can send a powerful message that vaccination is not only about personal health, but also about solidarity and consideration for the well being of others in their communities,\" Pound said.Reports suggest that the vaccine rollout in Japan is likely to be slowed by the need for local clinical trials. Some vaccines might not be readily available until May, although Suga said some would be ready in February.The Japanese public is becoming skeptical. A poll of 1,200 people last month by national broadcaster NHK showed 63% favored another postponement or cancellation.The IOC has said the Olympics, first delayed by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, will not be postponed again and would be canceled this time.The budget for the Tokyo Olympics is also soaring. The new official budget is $15.4 billion, which is $2.8 billion above the previous budget. The new costs are from the delay.Several audits by the Japanese government have said the costs are closer to at least $25 billion. The University of Oxford in a study published four months ago said these are the most expensive Summer Olympics on record. This was before the cost of the delay was added.All but $6.7 billion of Olympic funding is public money. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:52:41 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/senior-ioc-member-says-hes-not-sure-tokyo-games-will-happen/article33526781.ece\\n',\n",

Besides, the scope of DST was expanded to include transactions that use Indian data if the firm’s revenue from India is Rs. 2 crore and above. The Commerce Ministry considers this levy very moderate and applies it equally on all overseas e-commerce operators doing business in India.In its detailed report, the office of USTR said the law explicitly exempts Indian companies, and targets non-Indian firms. This impacts U.S technology companies as they are taxed higher than their Indian counterparts. USTR noted that of the 119 companies liable under DST, 86 are U.S. companies.The tax is levied on companies with no permanent establishment in India, and is applied on a firm’s revenue rather than income. This is inconsistent with the international tax principles, it added.According to the office’s estimates, the tax creates an additional burden of $30 million per year for the American companies. This is because India levies digital tax on various categories of services that are not taxed in other countries.In addition to this, USTR said DST increases the compliance cost of companies, which could run into millions.Taking note of USTR’s report, India said it would take appropriate action keeping in view the overall interest of the nation.India submitted its comments to the USTR on July 15, 2020 and participated in bilateral consultations in November. It stuck with the fact that Equalisation Levy is not discriminatory. Ministry of Commerce and Industry said it clarified that EL was applied prospectively and has no extra-territorial application.“The levy does not discriminate against any U.S. companies, as it applies equally to all non-resident e-commerce operators, irrespective of their country or residence,” the ministry said.The purpose of EL is to ensure fair competition, reasonableness and exercise the ability of governments to tax businesses that have a close nexus with the Indian market through digital operations, it added.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:52:53 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/india-denies-us-claim-that-its-digital-services-tax-is-discriminatory/article33528406.ece\\n\",\n",

Click here to subscribe for free.)YouTube has removed several videos that U.S. President Donald Trump has posted on his channel and warned that any channel found to be posting three times within 90 days with false claims on U.S. election results will be permanently removed from the Google-owned video platform. The move comes in the wake of the unprecedented storming of the U.S. Capitol by Mr. Trump’s supporters on Wednesday and thus disrupting the constitutional process of counting and certification of the Electoral College votes of the presidential elections. Four people, including a woman, died in the clashes between protesters and police. “Over the last month, we’ve removed thousands of videos which spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos that President Trump posted on Wednesday to his channel,” Google said in a statement. “Due to the disturbing events that transpired on Wednesday, and given that the election results have been certified, any channel posting new videos with these false claims in violation of our policies will now receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming,” it said. “Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube,” Google said in its statement.Mr. Trump’s YouTube channel has 2.68 million subscribers. Following the violence that erupted at the U.S. Capitol after his supporters stormed the building, YouTube has removed most of his videos from the rally he addressed earlier in the day. YouTube believes that those videos alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 elections violated its policies. YouTube said that grace period was supposed to expire on January 21, after Inauguration Day. But since the election results have been certified, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, the Google-owned video platform says it’s ending the grace period now. Earlier, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that President Donald Trump’s accounts on its popular social media platforms — Facebook and Instagram — would remain suspended until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on January 20. Announcing the decision, Mr. Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing President Trump to continue to use the platform during this period is “simply too great.” This is for the first time probably that Facebook has taken such an extreme step to ban and block the social media handles of a head of the State and that too of the United States. On Wednesday, Twitter also blocked Mr. Trump’s account for 12 hours and removed three of his tweets including a video.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:53:04 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/youtube-removes-several-videos-posted-on-trumps-channel/article33526218.ece\\n\",\n",

The first such meeting was convened by China in July, and was attended by Pakistan, Nepal and Afghanistan. This was followed by a five-member grouping in November attended by China, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.The January 6 meeting was attended by all five countries that have taken part in these dialogues — Pakistan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh — and was a follow-up to the two earlier meetings, Ms. Hua said.“In this meeting, the representatives shared their experience on anti-epidemic and poverty relief,” she said. “They talked about dealing with the impact of the pandemic, resuming economic and trade cooperation, dealing with non-traditional security challenges and advancing sustainable development, and reached an initial consensus. It shows our strong will and confidence in dealing with challenges together and achieving cooperation. China would like to work with all sides in implementing our consensus and to make greater contribution to building a regional community with shared future for health.”In the previous two rounds, the countries also discussed how to work more closely together under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to boost their post-COVID-19 economic recovery and agreed that countries linked by land ports should establish joint response mechanisms in border areas, apart from committing to greater information sharing and international cooperation.At the July quadrilateral dialogue with Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi proposed extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan, as well as taking forward an economic corridor plan with Nepal, called the Trans-Himalayan Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network.Mr. Wang told the conference the four countries were “connected by mountains and rivers”, and also offered to share China’s expertise and capacities on COVID-19 vaccines.

It featured prominently in an investigation conducted by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2015.The complaint says Lasantha Wickrematunge was killed a few days before he was to testify in a defamation case filed by Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa over an article implicating him in a corruption scandal involving the purchase of fighter planes.

The court dismissed the suit, saying it lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Gotapaya Rajapaksa was entitled to foreign official immunity.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s proposals to remove so-called third-party cookies from its popular Chrome browser and Chromium browser engine. Cookies are small pieces of text kept on devices to keep track of user information such as the login name. They\\'re used to help businesses more effectively target advertising and fund free online content such as newspapers, but they can also be used to track users across the internet. Google has proposed replacing third-party cookies with its own tools, as part of a “digital sandbox\" set to be rolled out in 2022. But the watchdog said the changes could hurt publishers\\' ability to make money as well as undermine digital ad competition, entrenching Google\\'s market power.“Google\\'s Privacy Sandbox proposals will potentially have a very significant impact on publishers like newspapers, and the digital advertising market. But there are also privacy concerns to consider,\" the CMA\\'s Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said in a statement. Regulators will work with the U.K.\\'s privacy commissioner and engage with Google during the investigation, he said. Chrome is the world\\'s dominant web browser, and many others like Microsoft\\'s Edge are based on Google\\'s Chromium technology. In a market study last year, the CMA found that Google controls more than 90% of the U.K.\\'s 7.3 billion-pound (USD 10 billion) search advertising market. Google stressed that it hasn\\'t made any changes yet and it\\'s collaborating with the industry to come up with the best solution. The company pointed out that other browsers such as Safari and Firefox have already started blocking third-party cookies but also acknowledged that such moves hurt the ability of content creators, newsrooms, web developers and videographers to make money.“Creating a more private web, while also enabling the publishers and advertisers who support the free and open internet, requires the industry to make major changes to the way digital advertising works,\" the company said. The CMA opened its investigation after receiving a complaint from an industry lobbying group, Marketers for an Open Web, which has said the changes would create a “walled garden\" owned by Google and deny publishers access to cookies they use to sell digital ads, crimping their revenues by up to two-thirds.“Providing more directly identifiable, personal information to Google does not protect anyone\\'s privacy,\" said the group, made up of technology and publishing companies. “We believe that the CMA\\'s investigation will confirm this and save the web for future generations.\"\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:53:23 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-watchdog-investigates-googles-ad-data-revamp-proposals/article33530517.ece\\n',\n",

One of the activists said they could still be charged under a tough national security law.The activists were accused of taking part in an unofficial primary election last year that authorities said was part of a plan to paralyse the Legislative Council and subvert state power. The primary was held to choose the best candidates to field as the pro-democracy camp sought to win a majority of seats.The mass arrests on Wednesday were the biggest move against Hong Kong’s democracy movement since Beijing imposed the national security law in the semi-autonomous territory last June to quell dissent following months of anti-government protests in 2019.Three of the 55 arrested people were not released — activists Joshua Wong and Tam Tak-chi, who were already in jail on separate charges, and former Hong Kong Democratic Party Chairman Wu Chi-wai, who remained in custody for failing to meet bail conditions in a separate protest-related case. Mr. Wu had been granted bail last month after being charged with inciting others to join unauthorised protests in July 2019. He was ordered to surrender his travel documents, and authorities later learned that he did not hand in his British National Overseas passport.Police said none of the activists arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of subversion under the security law had been formally charged. Former pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting told reporters that determinations of whether to formally prosecute people in Hong Kong are not based on evidence, but on a “political decision” by officials.“They haven’t made any charges against us yet,” said Mr. Lam, who was among those arrested on Wednesday. “But I’m quite sure that they will charge some of us sooner or later, whether they have sufficient evidence or not.”He said the purpose of the arrests was to silence Hong Kong's people and create a “chilling effect.”Separately, three people were sentenced to up to 5 1/2 years in prison on Friday for rioting at Hong Kong's airport and assaulting a Chinese journalist in August 2019 at the height of the anti-government protests.Protesters blockaded the city’s airport for two days.

File\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit: \\nAFP\\n  The United Nations fears “massive community transmission” of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Ethiopia’s troubled Tigray region, fuelled by displacement and the collapse of health services, as humanitarian workers finally begin to access the region two months after fighting began. Hospitals have been looted, even destroyed. A new U.N. report based on the first on-the-ground assessments confirms some of the grim concerns around Tigray’s some six million people since the conflict erupted on November 4 between Ethiopian forces and those of the Tigray region. The crisis has threatened to destabilise one of Africa’s most powerful and populous countries and pull in neighbours such as Sudan. Tigray leaders dominated Ethiopia’s government for nearly three decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power and sidelined them amid sweeping reforms that won him the Nobel Peace Prize. Abiy has rejected international “interference” in the conflict even as the U.N. and others pleaded for weeks for unhindered access to Tigray as food, medicines and other supplies ran out. Now COVID-19 has emerged as the latest source of alarm. “Only five out of 40 hospitals in Tigray are physically accessible,” the new U.N. report issued on Thursday says. “Apart from those in (the Tigray capital) Mekele, the remaining hospitals are looted and many reportedly destroyed.” It does not say who did the looting. COVID-19 surveillance and control work was interrupted for more than a month in Tigray, and that, along with the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, “is feared to have facilitated massive community transmission of the pandemic,” the report says. Ethiopia has one of the highest COVID-19 caseloads on the African continent with more than 1,27,000 confirmed infections. While its rate of daily cases has declined in recent weeks, officials have not said whether they have been receiving any data from the Tigray region. “Health facilities outside of major cities are non-functional and those in the major cities are partially working with limited to no stock of supplies and absence of health workers,” the U.N. report says. The report also says the Tigray region remains volatile. “Localised fighting and insecurity continues, with fighting reported in rural areas and in the peripheries of Mekele, Shiraro and Shire among other locations, as of last week,” it says. The overall humanitarian situation is “dire,” the U.N. says, with food supplies “very limited” and widespread looting reported. “Only locally produced food items are available and at increasing prices, making basic goods unaffordable.” Most Tigray residents are subsistence farmers, and the conflict disrupted the harvest. Two important camps hosting tens of thousands of refugees from nearby Eritrea remain unreachable – another source of alarm as the presence of Eritrean troops has been confirmed in Tigray. No one knows how many thousands of people have been killed in the conflict. At least five humanitarian workers have been killed.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:53:44 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-fears-massive-covid-19-transmission-in-ethiopias-tigray/article33529087.ece\\n',\n",

Observers had expected Mr. Kim to use the first congress of the ruling Workers’ Party in five years to send conciliatory gestures toward Seoul and Washington as he faces deepening economic troubles at home.In his speech on the third day of the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Kim “declared the general orientation and the policy stand of our party for comprehensively expanding and developing the external relations,” the Korean Central News Agency said Friday.Mr. Kim also examined relations with South Korea “as required by the prevailing situation and the changed times,” KCNA said.The congress is the party’s top decision-making body which review past projects, lay out new priorities and reshuffle top officials. This month’s congress was convened as Mr. Kim is struggling to overcome what he calls “multiple crises” caused by an economy battered by pandemic-related border closings, a series of natural disasters and U.S.-led sanctions.In his opening-day speech, Mr. Kim admitted his previous economic developmental plans had failed and vowed to lay out a new five-year development plan. On the second day of the meeting, he said he would bolster his country's military capability.The congress comes as Mr. Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump has remained stalled for about two years because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. President-elect Joe Biden, who is to take office on January 20, has called Mr. Kim a “thug” and is unlikely to hold any direct meeting with him unless North Korea takes serious steps toward denuclearisation.Ties between the Koreas once flourished after Mr. Kim entered talks with Mr. Trump. But Pyongyang halted exchanges with Seoul and resumed harsh rhetoric against it after Mr. Kim’s second summit with Mr. Trump in Vietnam in early 2019 collapsed over Mr. Trump’s rebuttal of Mr. Kim’s push for sweeping sanctions relief in return for a limited denuclearisation step.Some observers say North Korea is frustrated because Seoul has failed to break away from Washington and revive stalled joint economic projects held back by the U.S.-led sanctions. They also speculate North Korea initially thought South Korea would help it win sanctions relief but got upset after Mr. Kim returned home empty-handed from the 2019 summit with Mr. Trump.Experts say North Korea may reach out South Korea first to promote reconciliation mood before pushing for talks with the Biden administration. The stalled Kim-Trump diplomacy began after South Korean officials met Mr. Kim in early 2018 and conveyed to Washington his intent to deal away his nuclear programme in exchange of economic and political benefits. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:53:52 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kim-jong-un-vows-to-improve-ties-with-outside-world-at-party-meeting/article33526657.ece\\n\",\n",

By then, it had already cleared all internal WHO approval protocols and been printed.The mystery over the spiked report became a headache for WHO and a problem for the Italian government. The document noted that Italy hadn’t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006 and that its initial response as virus cases multiplied was “improvised, chaotic and creative.” Prosecutors in Italy’s Bergamo province are investigating whether any criminal liability should be assigned over the vast number of deaths after Italy in late February became the first Western nation with a significant outbreak. They have questioned the reports lead coordinator, who has said an Italian WHO official pressured him to falsify the date of the pandemic plan.WHO previously said the report was removed because it contained unspecified “factual inaccuracies” and wasn’t reposted because a different review process was adopted instead. Dr. Kluge said on Thursday that the inaccuracies concerned a timeline about the virus in China, which the authors had immediately deleted and had new versions of the report printed without it. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:53:54 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/who-denies-accusations-of-removing-critical-covid-19-report-under-italys-pressure/article33526459.ece\\n\",\n",

Ms. Hua tweeted a video of that incident on Thursday. She said “while U.S. mainstream media denounced the protesters at the U.S. Capitol as ‘mobs’, they had called the violent protesters in Hong Kong as \\'democratic heroes’, saying that the U.S. people were standing with them”, the official Xinhua news agency quoted her as saying. \"The stark contrast in the reactions and choice of words are thought-provoking and worthy of our reflection,” she said. \"What words did they use about Hong Kong?

In Hong Kong on Wednesday, more than 50 pro-democracy activists were arrested in raids across the SAR, in the biggest such move since the passing of a national security law last year, following which the mass protests, which drew hundreds of thousands of mostly peaceful protesters who marched for democracy through much of 2019, have all but faded.“Double standards are rampant,” said the Communist Party-run Global Times in an editorial. \"In Hong Kong, violent actions are described as a \\'beautiful sight’, in the U.S., people involved in this chaos are called ‘mobs’.” The newspaper reported that “words like ‘karma’, ‘retribution\\' and ‘deserving’ were frequently mentioned in Chinese netizens’ comments”.The protests \"had pricked the beautiful bubble of the universal values shaped by the U.S.”, Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University, told the newspaper. \"The \\'beacon of democracy\\' is falling down, or at least becomes gloomy,” he said. \"It might be too early to declare the \\'twilight of the gods\\' in the U.S., but that day is coming closer and closer.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:54:05 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/comparing-us-capitol-to-hong-kong-china-slams-stark-contrast-in-us-reaction/article33525741.ece\\n',\n",

And I mean on direct threats to India, we have always been very clear. Whether on Kashmir we have been very supportive of India in the Security Council, we have not let the Chinese play any kind of procedural games,” said Emmanuel Bonne, Diplomatic Advisor to the French President, speaking at a webinar organised by the Vivekananda International Foundation on Thursday.Referring to the ongoing stand-off in eastern Ladakh, he said that when it came to the Himalayas, the statement had been “perfectly clear”. “What we say publicly, we say to the Chinese also privately. We need to be robust…” Mr. Bonne said.Mr. Bonne was in India for the 3rd India-France strategic dialogue led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval from the Indian side. On the dialogue, he said they had discussed strategic opportunities, defence and security relationship, which meant equipment and also military cooperation, in particular in the Indian Ocean region information sharing.Mr. Bonne thanked India for its support recently in “countering disinformation” from Turkey and Pakistan, and said that their relations with Pakistan were “at a historic low”. “We very much appreciate the support we got not only from your authorities but also from Indian civil society when our country was under attack by some leaders in Turkey and Pakistan and in other countries,” he said.Saying that they wanted China to respect “certain rules, be less aggressive,” Mr. Bonne said China should work in the same framework as others and it was important for France to be more defensive, aggressive but also be more dynamic and nimble, and join forces. Talking of India-France cooperation in the maritime domain, Mr. Bonne referred to the ongoing information exchange and asked India to play a greater role in the European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) initiative in Abu Dhabi. “We already have an Indian officer with us,” Mr. Bonne said, and added that if India could “bring some capacities such as a frigate or other Navy capacities...it will be a demonstration of convergence of our interest and capacity to operate together”.Stating that France was aware of and shared India’s concerns on Djibouti, he said his country was also aware of concerns over Mozambique because of geopolitical and security reasons, and “the investments China is making in the region”. “In Djibouti, we are ready to share our facilities with you [India], we welcome your Navy in Djibouti,” Mr. Bonne added.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:54:21 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/when-china-breaks-rules-we-have-to-be-very-robust-and-clear-french-diplomat/article33524361.ece\\n',\n",

In Cranston’s latest TV outing, the miniseries Your Honor, there are echoes of a comparable morality play, but the similarities end there.Borrowing the premise of the Israeli show Kvodo, Your Honor follows the butterfly effect-like spiraling aftermath of a motor accident — Adam (Hunter Doohan), the son of New Orleans judge Michael Desiato (Cranston), runs over and kills the son of ruthless mob boss Jimmy Baxter (Michael Stuhlbarg). As Desiato uses his power and contacts to cover up his son’s mistake, the web of lies leads to a collision course between him and Baxter.It is fair to say that Cranston was prepared for the Walter White parallels. He compared the two characters at a recent virtual interview session — where he was joined by the show’s writer, Peter Moffat, and Edward Berger, who directed the first three episodes. “The things that Walter White did, the measures he took to procure wealth… they were his own design,” Cranston says, adding, “And he did exactly what he planned to do. Michael Desiato doesn’t have the luxury of foresight. If you look at his trajectory as a character, it is almost like a regular guy’s extremely animalistic response to his circumstances. There’s very little premeditation, at least at first.” This “animalistic response” is most apparent when initially, he tries to set up a teenager named Kofi Jones (Lamar Johnson) for the vehicular manslaughter charge. Speaking about the show’s conception, screenwriter and playwright Moffat (Criminal Justice), who developed Your Honor, says, “Liz [executive producer Liz Glotzer] asked me what I would do if my child accidentally killed someone in a hit-and-run. She asked what my next three steps or three questions would be, and I started noting them down. By the end of the night, I had over a hundred questions and we both knew this show was going to work.”Michael Stuhlbarg had previously worked with Cranston on the film Trumbo, interestingly, also set in New Orleans. When it came to “chemistry readings” during the production of Your Honor, Cranston knew he wanted Stulhbarg for the role of Jimmy Baxter — a self-made Scottish immigrant who becomes a feared mafia boss. “One of the things that Peter and I thought would work with Baxter’s character was that it should be contrary to mafia stereotypes. Stuhlbarg’s stature (5’5”) really played into that as well, and, of course, he’s a tremendous actor.” Your Honor has some overlap with recent American good-man-goes-bad thrillers, most notably The Night Of, but one of the areas where it distinguishes itself is the visual treatment. The show’s stunning opening sequence has drawn praise from critics.The show’s 10-episode run will come to an end mid-February, and eventually it will find its way to Netflix and company. Binge if you must, but its slow-burning pleasures are, one would argue, the domain of an earlier era of television — and that’s a good thing.

              " '\\nThe missing Margazhi moments \\nWhat a disappointment to have the live experience snatched out of my eager ken\\n\\nWhat a disappointment to have the live experience snatched out of my eager ken\\n\\nIllustration: Mihir Balantrapu \\xa0 As the Margazhi music season winds to a close, one saw it take on a brave new digital avatar this time to leap over the hurdles that the pandemic created. But even as all of us gamely adapted to the new and heavily-depleted normal, allow me to lament the havoc wrought by the virus on the harmless pursuit of people-watching that’s always been such a joyous indulgence for us lesser mortals. Margazhi has invariably been as much about audiences as about the music. One ear is tuned to the glorious notes pouring from the stage while the other flinches each time the mama in the next seat slaps the life out of his thigh in perfect beat with the singer. I often worry about the black and blue bruises aficionados must carry through December and January with nary a murmur of complaint. Then there’s the tut-tut-tutting that rises and falls like a Mexican wave, flowing down the hallowed aisles, punctuated by sudden sharp cries of sabash. As arms beat, heads bob, tongues click, it’s a veritable moving sea of musical appreciation around you. Accompanied visually by silk veshtis, saris and quantities of alarming jewellery, and aurally by stentorian comments and conversations. How can one expect virtual concerts to match up to this in any imaginable way? Some organisers tried heavily embellished sets and backgrounds to make up for the lack. Others bravely added on, horror of horrors, canned applause! As if this were an episode of Friends! My question is, can they can the tut-tut-tut? If they can’t, the silly idea should be canned. I have been a flâneuse in many cities and many streets, but the delight of being one in a Chennai sabha during Margazhi is unsurpassed, equalled only, of course, by being one in a sabha canteen. The dishes on offer, the mind-boggling speeds of ingestion, the palpable tension of choosing between Mysore Bonda and Keera Vadai, the last-minute capitulation to a Badam Halwa, the race to beat Kili Pachai sari to the vacant table… the thrills are endless. Yet, what a Carnatic concert reminds me most of is Maths exams. In our class, we had a sprinkling of Tamil students. On D-Day, they would file in quietly, not a hair out of place, pencils sharpened, having eaten lots of okra over the previous 24 hours to sharpen numerical skills. As I gazed wildly at a question paper that had inexplicably been set in a foreign language, out their pencils would come and with astounding speed they would proceed to solve the sums. Then the little horrors would check their answers at about the time everyone else was passing chits for Q.5. Of course, they would score centum. It was only many years later that I learnt that ‘centum’ is an ancient Tamil word for ‘Above Average Performance’. That’s how a concert unfolds too. In the listeners file, they take their seats, palms poised. As the curtain rises, the test begins. They have to get the answers fast — which song will be first? As soon as the alapana starts, guess the ragam! Then the talam! Who is the composer? What colour was the jamkalam he sat on while composing? [Note for writers: nobody does anything as pedestrian as ‘sing’, everyone ‘renders’.] The speed of this intellectual exercise is usually matched by the pace at which the concert unfolds. The artistes get into action briskly, launch a song, get through it at breakneck speed, and on to the next, attacking each like an arithmetic problem, with business-like precision and swift raga explorations. At an exact juncture in the formula, proceedings are handed over to the percussionists. The technical expertise of both artiste and audience is of an astonishing level — and very quickly everyone scores a centum. Then they file out. Just as I settle deeper into my seat, loosen my limbs, and calm my monkey mind, I realise with a start that the concert is over. It turns out the snappy Mangalam was the cue to leave. I troop out after them, feeling as foolish as I used to after Maths exams. Can a digital Margazhi hope to replicate even a fraction of this rich drama? I humbly suggest that it should not even try. Simply stream the music, avoid the SFX, and we flâneurs will wait patiently for next year.

Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said that the violent incidents in the American capital will not succeed in subverting the democratic process.“Indian position on this issue has been expressed clearly in the tweet of the Prime Minister. It was expressed that he was hurt by the incident of rioting and violence in Washington DC. Handover of political power should take place in an organised and peaceful manner. Unlawful protests of this nature cannot damage the process of democracy,” Mr. Srivastava said in response to a question during the weekly press briefing.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said on Thursday that the mob attack on the U.S. Congress had left him “distressed”. “The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests,” Mr Modi had said. The statements from the Indian side came even as some Indian flags carried by Indian-American supporters of President Trump were spotted among the crowd that attacked the U.S. Congress. Mr. Srivastava, however, did not elaborate on that in his response.India, like other countries, is gearing up for the transition of power from the Trump administration to the Biden-Harris team, which will take over on January 20. An immediate issue of bilateral concern is likely to be India’s purchase of a $400 million missile defence system from Russia despite the U.S.’ objection.Outgoing U.S. ambassador to India Kenneth Juster on January 5 spoke about the choices that India would have to make in going ahead with the deal, saying that punitive measures under CAATSA — Countering of America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act — were not aimed at the friends and allies of the United States. “India seeks to keep its options open and purchase from any country. But there are also limitations that imposes, and choices that might ultimately need to be made,” Mr. Juster had said.In response to the envoy’s remarks, Mr. Srivastava said that India conducts its foreign policy on the basis of choices made to safeguard its “national security interest”. “India and the U.S. have a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia. We pursue an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies, which are guided by our national security interest,” said Mr. Srivastava.Also read: U.S. to modify H-1B visa selection process, to give priority to wages, skill levelHe took note of the recent announcements in the U.S. government, which extended to the current suspension of entry of certain categories of immigrants and non-immigrants to the United States, and said India was “engaged” with the U.S. on this issue to reduce “inconvenience to Indian nationals”.“There is recognition in the U.S. of the fact that Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth of the U.S. economy and helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage,” said Mr. Srivastava.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:54:36 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/handover-of-power-to-biden-harris-administration-should-be-peaceful-says-india/article33531864.ece\\n',\n",

It is for the international community to hold Pakistan to account and ensure that it takes credible action against terror groups, terror infrastructure and individual terrorists,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.“The timing of these actions clearly suggests the intention of conveying a sense of compliance ahead of the APJG (Asia Pacific Joint Group) meeting and next FATF plenary meeting in February 2021. It has become routine for Pakistan to come up with such farcical actions prior to important meetings,” he added in response to a question from The Hindu on a spate of action from Pakistan.In December 2020, LeT chief Hafiz Saeed was given a second conviction on terror charges in cases involving terror financing. Lakhvi, who had been arrested on January 2 this year, five years after he was given bail in the Mumbai 26/11 terror attacks case in Pakistan, was also charged with terror financing.On Friday, an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Lahore, convicted Lakhvi for five years each in three cases, to be served concurrently. Meanwhile, on Thursday, an Anti-Terrorism Court in Gujranwala in Pakistan issued an arrest warrant against Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar, in a terror financing case as well.All the actions came ahead of a meeting of the 9-nation Asia Pacific Joint Group (APJG) of the Paris based watchdog on terror financing FATF this month, that will review Pakistan’s performance on the 27-point action list it was given when it was put on the greylist of “jurisdictions under increased monitoring”.Thus far, Pakistan has cleared 21 of the 27 markers according to the FATF, and the APJG will submit its report on whether it has made progress on the remaining six. The FATF plenary session in February will then decide whether Pakistan should remain on the greylist, be downgraded to the “blacklist” of sanctioned “high-risk” countries like Iran and North Korea, or let off the list.The FATF’s last plenary, which had put off a decision on Pakistan for more than a year since its deadline in October 2019, had made a particular mention of the need for the Imran Khan government to prosecute UN designated persons, and demonstrate effective actions against them in court and freezing their assets. (http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/d-i/iceland/documents/increased-monitoring-october-2020.html ).Saeed, Lakhvi, and Azhar are wanted for some of the biggest terror attacks in India, including the Mumbai 26/11 IC-814 hijacking, Parliament attack and Pulwama bombing, but are yet to be brought to justice in Pakistan for them.On Friday, India, that has begun its two-year term at the UN Security Council, was named to chair two key terror-related committees, including the 1267/1373 Taliban Sanctions Committee, and the Counter Terrorism Committee (in 2022), which will make India’s Permanent Representative T.S.

If vaccines packed in dry ice is being transported in the passenger cabin of an aircraft, then the flight crew should be properly trained on the hazards and risks of its transportation, it noted. Dry ice transforms into carbon dioxide gas at temperatures higher than -78 degrees Celsius under normal atmospheric pressure and, therefore, it is classified as “dangerous goods” by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), it said. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said, “Adequate number of carbon dioxide detectors should be available in the cabin. Such detectors should be located at locations for timely and reliable detection of dangerous concentration of carbon dioxide.” “All operators while engaging in transportation of COVID-19 vaccines packed with dry ice shall establish the maximum quantity of dry ice that can be loaded in a given cargo hold or in the main deck (passenger cabin) when a passenger version is deployed for all cargo operations,” it said. The country is preparing for the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and the second nationwide mock drill on the drive was conducted on Friday.

Mr. Tomar blamed the unions for their failure to come up with any alternative proposal apart from repeal.At this point, Balbir Singh Rajewal who heads his own faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, raised his voice and shouted, accusing the government of being adamant. He said that the Central Government did not have a right to interfere in agricultural activity, indicating that there are previous Supreme Court judgements establishing this.

File\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit: \\nSushil Kumar Verma  The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider after three weeks a petition filed by a group of women against the compulsory nature of sacred confessions to priests in Christianity.Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the petitioners, said “confessions are being abused”.But Chief Justice Bobde said the veracity of such allegations would depend on the individual facts in every case.“There cannot be a rule to impose confessions on a worshipper... Ladies are forced to confess before the priest... The court has to see whether confessions are an integral part of the religion,” Mr. Rohatgi went on to submit.The senior lawyer said forced confessions violated the right to privacy.When asked by the court why it should intervene in an obviously ecclesiastical issue like this, Mr. Rohatgi reminded the court about its interventions in questions concerning the personal laws and customs of communities like the Bohra Muslims and Parsis.He said the court could examine the issues in the petition as they came within the ambit of the questions of faith, rights of women and equality referred to a nine-judge Constitution Bench in the Sabarimala case.He sought more time to amend the petition and add more facts.Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, when asked for an opinion by the court, said the whole issue stemmed from the Jacobite-Orthodox dispute. The Supreme Court had upheld the validity of the 1934 Constitution of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church to govern the parishes under the church.He suggested that the Kerala High Court should hear it. “The Kerala High Court knows the entire case history,” he said.Earlier, the court had agreed to examine a separate but similar plea by members of the Malankara Syrian Church in Kerala seeking a declaration that forced confessions were unconstitutional by nature.The petition had said these confessions may involve sexual exploitation of parishioners. “Church is forcing the members to mandatorily confess and mandatorily make payment of monies/dues and the said practises indulged in by the church are of public nature, affecting human dignity and liberty of thought and that the believers have been forced to remain meek and quiet out of fear of removal from parish membership, social ostracisation, etc,” it had stated.“This pernicious practice of forced, compulsory and mandatory confession [not being voluntary] from every member, both men and women, is causing several other problems, including sexual exploitation of women and blackmailing,” the petition, filed by Mathew T. Mathachan and two others, had said.It had sought a judicial declaration that mandatory confession is a violation of the right to privacy, liberty and dignity of the parishioners.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:55:04 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-plea-against-compulsory-nature-of-confessions-to-priests/article33528636.ece\\n',\n",

AK Mor, Senior Research Fellow at the USI, and presented at a webinar titled “Prevailing Stress Levels in Indian Army due to Prolonged Exposure to Counter Insurgency/Counter Terrorism environment”, organised in October 2020 and uploaded on the website on December 07 last.While operational stressors are well understood and accepted by Army personnel, the study says that non-operational stressors that add on “have compounding adverse effects on health and combat efficiency of soldiers and thus affecting their respective units too.”In this regard, officers experience comparatively much higher cumulative stress levels, compared to the Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) and Other Ranks (OR) and the stress causative factors are also different.The study observes that the overall job satisfaction and pride in uniform remains high amongst JCOs and ORs. “It seems to be a growing matter of concern amongst Officers, requiring urgent interventions from the highest levels of Government,” it says.“Despite harsh and challenging service conditions, Indian Army personnel remain highly motivated to serve in CI/ CT areas voluntarily... However, the Officers lack a similar level of trust, faith and confidence in their leadership that JCOs and ORs demonstrate,” it states.The study highlights that various management measures implemented by the Army and Defence Ministry in the last 15 years have not been able to achieve the desired results. “Units and sub-units under stress are likely to witness an increased number of incidents of indiscipline, unsatisfactory state of training, inadequate maintenance of equipment and low morale, motivation and esprit-de-corps, thereby, adversely affecting their combat preparedness and operational performance,” it says.Calling for an institutionalised approach, the study recommends that stress prevention and management should be treated “as a leadership role at Unit and Formation level.”Some of the major organisational causes of stress amongst officers, according to the study, include “inadequacies in the quality of leadership, overburdened commitments, inadequate resources, frequent dislocations, lack of fairness and transparency in postings and promotions, downgradation in pay and status, inadequate promotional avenues, lack of motivation amongst juniors, non-grant of leave, indifferent attitude of civilian officials and short command tenures.”For JCOs and ORs, some of the perceived organisational stressors include “delay and denial of leave, excessive engagements, domestic problems, humiliation by seniors, lack of dignity, unreasonable restrictions on use of mobiles, lack of recreational facilities, conflict with seniors as well as subordinates, health problems, the inadequacy of train reservation, inefficient administrative support, financial problems, lack of transparency in promotions, non-adherence to unit tarteebs, delay in crediting of financial claims and poor quality of rations as well as cooked food.”\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:37:37 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-half-of-army-personnel-under-severe-stress-study/article33528310.ece\\n',\n",

File photo\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit: PTI  The Supreme Court on Friday pushed the government to take a decision on a mercy petition filed by Balwant Singh Rajoana, facing capital punishment for the assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, before Republic Day.Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Rajoana, said it would be possible for the government to spare time for the mercy petition, which had been pending for the past eight years, as there is no foreign guest coming on January 26 for the Republic Day celebrations.Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj informed the court that the mercy plea file was being processed and had been submitted before the competent authority within the government. The President would take the final decision on whether Rajoana should live or not.Mr. Rohatgi said the petition was filed in 2012. The death penalty of his client should be commuted on the sole ground of the delay on the part of the government to decide on the clemency petition.“The long passage of eight years without a decision from the government side is fatal to the death penalty. This court has said in several judgments that a delay of eight years is a ground for reduction of punishment from death to life imprisonment... Whatever they [the government] may do today on his mercy plea is thus infructuous,” Mr. Rohatgi argued.Chief Justice Bobde said the government was merely asking for another week or two before taking a call.“He has been in prison for 25 years,” Mr. Rohatgi reminded.“Another week or two will not change anything,” the Bench said.It was then that Mr. Rohatgi pressed for a decision on the mercy plea before January 26. The court agreed, even as the government said that the file would be processed at the earliest.“January 26 is a good day to call it,” Chief Justice Bobde remarked orally.On December 4, the Supreme Court was livid to find that the Centre had kept a condemned man’s plea for Presidential mercy hanging in limbo despite having decided over a year ago to spare his life. The decision was taken in commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in 2019.However, the government had failed to make good its declaration till date.Rajoana, in a petition to the Supreme Court from his jail cell, had said his repeated pleas to the government about the fate of his mercy plea was met with silence. He called the delay inexplicable. Mr. Nataraj had explained that Rajoana’s plea was kept in abeyance because appeals filed by his fellow accused were pending in the Supreme Court.However, the court had said the law was already settled that once the government decided to recommend a Presidential pardon for a condemned man, the pendency of appeals in the Supreme Court of his co-accused could not delay the process initiated under Article 72 [Presidential pardon] of the Constitution.Moreover, the CJI had noted, Rajoana had no appeals pending in any court.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:55:07 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/decide-on-beant-singh-killer-rajoanas-mercy-plea-by-republic-day-sc-tells-govt/article33528017.ece\\n',\n",

Bobde, senior advocate Shyam Divan said India accounted for 30% of fatalities among forest rangers in the world.Chief Justice Bobde said forest officials were up against a very powerful force. “Proceeds of crime are in millions of dollars. This is an international crime. Recently, I was told that the pangolin skin trade extended to China because people believe they are good for certain things,” Chief Justice Bobde noted.The court said the Centre should consider involving premier organisations such as the CBI to help the forest staff.“There should even be a separate wing or wildlife division in the Enforcement Directorate with clean officials to track and investigate crimes of the poachers and the proceeds of their crimes... The amounts involved are huge and justify the formation of a separate wing by the ED,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre.Chief Justice Bobde pointed out how forest rangers in Assam were armed and “no one dares come near them”.“But in States like Madhya Pradesh, they roam around with lathis. In Karnataka, forest guards are in chappals and [carry] just lathis... In these States, forest guards are slapped around by poachers,” the CJI observed.He asked Maharashtra counsel Rahul Chitnis why forest officers in the State were not armed. Mr. Chitnis, however, insisted that they were.“But why this unequal situation among forest officials from State to State? Forest officers have larger responsibilities than police officers in cities. They patrol large tracts of uninhabited forests. A forest guard is alone in his duty, unlike a police officer in a city who can call for back-up,” Chief Justice Bobde said.Amicus curiae A.D.N. Rao said States did not utilise funds meant for arming the forest force.Mr. Divan said forest officers brave enough to take action were faced with a counterblast when they were made accused in various criminal cases by powerful forces operating behind the poachers.“Forest officers above a certain rank need arms for self-protection, bullet-proof vests, helmets and vehicles... the situation is serious. They are helpless and in danger, while poachers take undue advantage to carry out their nefarious activities. It is difficult to imagine how any law can be enforced by forest staff who are unarmed against heavily armed poachers,” Chief Justice Bobde said.The court asked the Solicitor General, Mr. Rao and Shyam Divan to make a joint submission on the measures that could be adopted to protect the forest staff so they could perform their duty without fear.

Phase I human clinical trials will commence during Feb-March 2021,” an email reply from the city-based vaccine maker told PTI.Phase I human clinical trials will be conducted in India, Bharat Biotech added.The Phase-1 trials will be conducted in Saint Louis University’s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit, the company sources said adding Bharat Biotech owns the rights to distribute the vaccine in all markets except USA, Japan and Europe.Krishna Ella, Chairman of Bharat Biotech had earlier said the company is focusing on the intranasal vaccine as the existing vaccines require two dose intramuscular injections and a country like India needs 2.6 billion syringes and needles which may add up to pollution.An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive, he had said.“One drop of vaccine in each of the nostrils is sufficient,” he had said.According to him, keeping several issues in mind Bharat Biotech tied up with Washington University School of Medicine for the single dose intranasal vaccine for COVID-19.He had said Bharat Biotech envisions that it would scale this vaccine to one billion doses, translating into equal number of individuals being vaccinated receiving a single-dose regimen.Bharat Biotech, upon obtaining required regulatory approval, will pursue further stages of clinical trials in India and undertake large scale manufacture of the vaccine at its GMP (good manufacturing practice) facility located in Genome Valley, here, the company had earlier said.The intranasal vaccine candidate has shown unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies and the technology and data having been already published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature, the company had said.Bharat Biotech has successfully completed enrollment of 25,800 volunteers for the Phase-3 trials of its COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:55:11 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bharat-biotech-to-begin-phase-1-trials-of-its-intranasal-vaccine-for-covid-19-in-feb-march/article33527212.ece\\n',\n",

Raju\\n A single-judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Justice M. Ganga Rao, has stayed till the next hearing on February 15 the finalisation of tenders pertaining to the solar power projects proposed to be developed by the State government for supplying free power to the farm sector. The case was filed by the TATA Power Renewable Energy Limited (TPREL), which argued that the dispute resolution mechanism provided for in the Requests for Selection (RfS) and the draft Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) had an effect of defeating the jurisdiction of the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) under Section 63 of the Electricity Act.In its writ petition, TPREL prayed for quashing the impugned RfS for a total capacity of 6,400 megawatts and the draft PPAs issued by the AP Green Energy Corporation Limited (APGECL). TPREL sought a direction to the APGECL to issue fresh RfS strictly in accordance with the guidelines for tariff-based competitive bidding process for procurement of power from grid connected solar photovoltaic projects stipulated by the Ministries of Power and New & Renewable Energy. The State government issued RfS for setting up solar power projects with a total 6,400 MW capacity in 10 solar parks (four in Kadapa, three in Anantapur, two in Prakasam and one in Kurnool district).The private sector power giant argued that the modification of certain directions pertaining to the tenure of the draft PPAs, sale of assets, revision of lease rents for private and assigned lands, generation compensation for back down, passing of safeguard and basic custom duties through tariff adjustment etc. by the State government was in violation of the Electricity Act and relevant guidelines laid down by the Centre. Appearing for the Energy Department and APGECL, government pleader Y.N. Vivekananda contended that the writ petition was not maintainable as the TPREL neither submitted a bid nor indicated a location in which it was interested. Senior advocate D. Prakash Reddy presented arguments on behalf of TPREL. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:19:10 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/interim-stay-on-finalisation-of-tenders-for-solar-power-projects/article33532456.ece\\n',\n",

Jagan Mohan Reddy in his inaugural address delivered virtually at the 63rd AP State Police Duty Meet here four days ago, Home Minister M. Sucharitha also saw a conspiracy to downplay the achievements of the State.Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the closing ceremony of the meet here on Thursday, Ms. Sucharitha pointed out that every incident in the series of razing of religious structures, or disfiguring of idols, coincided with the launch of a welfare scheme by the government. The Opposition was out to besmirch the YSRCP regime with baseless and concocted narratives. “It is a conspiracy to eclipse the schemes and show the government in poor light. We will definitely hit back by taking stringent action against the culprits,” she said.Criticising the opposition for “unnecessarily” blaming the government, she wondered how a government could function on the basis of faith. “All castes and religions are equal to us. Our government was formed with the blessings of people of all faiths,” she reiterated. Ms. Sucharitha said the government had prepared a new chariot at Antarvedi in place of the one that was gutted. The Home Minister also recalled that the government had decided to take up reconstruction of the religious structures razed by the previous government during the Krishna Pushkarams.Meanwhile, the Anantapur range bagged the ‘Overall Championship’ and received the trophy from the hands of Ms. Sucharitha.

The court posted the case for next hearing to January 18 even as Advocate-General S.

The petitioner has not demonstrated any such circumstances in the present petition,” Mr. Sriram argued, insisting that the case was open for the State to launch prosecution and there was material for it. Mr. Venkateswara Rao’s counsel maintained that his apprehension was reasonable because of the State’s action in placing him under suspension from May 31, 2019, and issuance of a charge sheet recently. In his bail petition, Mr. Venkateswara Rao stated that an FIR containing accusations having penal provisions of a sentence beyond seven years was prepared in consultation with “legal minds” and that he could be arrested either on the evening before a holiday, or weekend, and produced before a magistrate / special judge for remand in order to deny legal assistance.

Addressing a virtual summit on ‘Western Australia turning to India: Investing in its future’, jointly organised by the GoWA and the Indo-Australian Chamber of Commerce (IACC) on Thursday, Mr. Goutham Reddy said the State identified mining as one of its growth engines and issued 380 leases for major minerals, 1,735 quarry leases for cut and dressed blocks of granites, 1,083 quarry leases for industrial minerals and 4,177 quarry leases for other minor minerals.He said the government was focused on transforming the State into a major hub for electric mobility in the country, and that Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Tirupati were declared as model EM cities and hundreds of charging stations were planned to be set across the State.Besides, the government designated special ‘green zones’ with entry only to non-fossil fuel based vehicles. More importantly, it had been targeted to migrate the entire fleet of the APSRTC to electric mobility by the year 2029. The Minister said the Australian entrepreneurs should also look at the opportunities at Krishnapatnam in the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC). The other areas in which the Australians could invest were IT, optical products, automobiles, engineering and electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals and food processing.

Narasimha Rao, MLC P.V.N. Madhav, and senior leader P. Sanyasi Raju were arrested at different places and prevented from taking out their proposed ‘Ramateertha Yatra’.The police foiled the yatra at the Ramateertham junction, located about 12 km from the district headquarters. Annoyed at the forcible arrests, Mr. Narasimha Rao spoke to Mr. Amit Shah and sought his intervention. He also sought an inquiry into the denial of permission by the police only to the BJP, while the leaders of the YSRCP and the TDP had been allowed to visit the temple soon after the incident.There was high drama right from the early hours of the day with many leaders and activists arriving from Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts in spite of heavy deployment of police forces and barricading on the inter-district borders. A few of the leaders and activists had reached Ramateertham on Wednesday night itself. The yatra is aimed at exposing the government’s “failure” in tracing the culprits who had desecrated the idol at the historic temple believed to have been constructed in the 16th century. In their attempt to prevent the arrest of Mr. Veerraju, senior party leaders such as former MLA Gadde Babu Rao, N. Eswara Rao, and T. Harinath stood around him. Mr. Veerraju too resisted his arrest and deplored what he called the rude behaviour of the police.The police later shifted the leaders to a private guest house and released them at around 5 p.m. Earlier, Visakhapatnam Range Deputy Inspector General L.K.V.

Yediyurappa ordering the Finance Department to release ₹50 crore as the first tranche. Though this was assured in principle a few months ago, the release of funds has been officially sanctioned and certain formalities have to be completed by the Finance Department before the amount is transferred for the works to get started. This was stated by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha on Friday who pointed out that with the release of the first tranche the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) can commence the land acquisition work for the airport expansion. Though the expansion requires 240 acres the agencies concerned can proceed to acquire 115 acres of land required for runway extension and take up related works in a staggered manner as and when the funds are released. The airport currently has a runway length of 1740 metres and a breadth of 30 metres which is suitable for operating ATR-72 type of aircraft. The proposal is to increase the runway length to 2,750 metres and breadth to 45 metres which will be suitable for Airbus and Boeing aircraft. As per the airport master plan 182 acres is required for runway expansion while 58 acres is needed for the expansion of the terminal building complex. Mr. Simha has also sought an additional ₹150 crore for the project from the State government and urged the Chief Minister to announce the same in the forthcoming budget. The proposed runway extension entails creating a subway for the four-lane Mysuru-Nanjangud highway so as to obviate its diversion which would not only be prohibitive in terms of cost but would delay the project given the complexities involved in land acquisition for highway diversion.Sources in the Airport Authority of India said as soon as the KIADB transfers the land to AAI, the runway expansion and the subway construction works will take place. A diversion of a small stretch of the existing road, till the civil works pertaining to subway and runway are completed, will have to be taken up, the sources added. The current development also comes in the wake of constant rumours that the civilian airport in Mysuru is proposed to be handed over to the defence authorities, which, Mr. Simha, said, was a closed chapter. Mysuru airport will remain a civilian airport and there are plans afoot to increase air connectivity to different destinations which will give a boost to investment and tourism, he said. At present short haul flights connect Mysuru to Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Kochi, Goa, Chennai, Hyderabad and Belagavi. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:56:01 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-airport-expansion-gets-a-financial-boost/article33531358.ece\\n',\n",

Devaraj Urs Road, the city’s major commercial hub, appears imminent as consensus was reached among the shopkeepers and other stakeholders who came together here at a meeting on Thursday over the proposal of Mysuru traffic police for easing parking woes, particularly during peak hours.As a majority of the four-wheelers parked on the road belonged to the shopkeepers, depriving parking space for the shoppers and tourists, the police came up with the idea of introducing the rule where no four-wheeler could be parked beyond four hours. The flouting vehicles would be wheel-locked and penalty would be imposed on the erring vehicle owner.Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) S.N. Sandesh Kumar, who proposed the new parking rule, told The Hindu that all shopkeepers have agreed to the idea and have promised to cooperate with the police in easing parking problems on the road. The meeting organised by the Devaraja Traffic Police was attended by traders, shopkeepers, members of the traffic advisory committee and other stakeholders.“The proceedings of the meeting will be sent to the Commissioner of Police, who will take a final call. An official notification on the new rule was expected to be issued soon in view of the consent from the stakeholders,” Mr. Kumar said.The shopkeepers were told about alternative parking space available for their vehicles in the vicinity of the road.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:56:10 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-four-hour-parking-rule-on-devaraj-urs-road-appears-certain/article33530423.ece\\n',\n",

Sriramulu\\n\\xa0 The cash-strapped State government is making attempts to divert funds set aside for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for infrastructure works. Despite objections from within the BJP and the Opposition Congress, the full funds allocated to four major departments by the Social Welfare Department this financial year may end up being utilised for this purpose.A sum of ₹5,170 crore was sought to be diverted to works other than SC/ST welfare citing a ‘deemed expenditure’ clause. While provisions of the Karnataka Scheduled Castes Sub Allocation and Tribal Sub Plan (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Resources) Act, 2013, do not allow bulk transfer of allocations, the Finance Department has told the Social Welfare Department to transfer the full allocation made in four major departments for the welfare of SC/ST people, officials said.From its allocation of ₹26,614.69 crore in the 2020–21 budget, the Social Welfare Department has sub-allocated ₹5,170 crore for the welfare of SC/ST people in these four departments. This comes from Water Resources Department (₹2,035.89 crore), Public Works Department (₹1,427.97 crore), Urban Development Department (₹1,341.97 crore), and Minor Irrigation Department (₹364 crore).Withdraws statementThe issue turned into a heated discussion in the Legislative Assembly in the recently concluded winter session where members from both the BJP and the Congress objected to diversion of funds meant for SC/ST welfare, and criticised Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu for justifying the diversion under ‘deemed expenditure’ clause. The Minister had withdrawn his statement later.The Finance Department informed the Social Welfare Department that the Chief Minister’s permission has been taken to consider this as ‘deemed expenditure’ since there is a severe shortage of resources owing to COVID-19. Funds earmarked for the four departments will be taken as ‘deemed expenditure’ to make bill payment. The instruction to the Social Welfare Department, sources said, came through an unofficial note from the Finance Department. It had asked the Social Welfare Department to consider the full allocation to these four departments as ‘deemed expenditure’.However, the Social Welfare Department has refused to consider the letter, and pointed to violation of the Act. Sources in the department said they had opposed it, but acknowledged that there have been serious attempts to divert funds. “The department is insisting that if infrastructure projects have to be funded, then the cost can be borne in proportion to the SC or ST population in the area. It has been conveyed to the Finance Department multiple times that bulk allocation is not possible,” a source said.A senior government official pointed out that section 7 (D) of the Act states that in the non-divisible projects where it is not possible to identify how many SC/ST people benefited, only a portion of the project amount can be provided, and whole allocation cannot be considered as ‘deemed expenditure’. Meanwhile, an office-bearer of the Government SC/ST Employees’ Association said that action should be initiated against officials who suggested this measure in violation of the Act.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:56:27 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-attempts-to-dip-into-scst-sub-plan-fund-for-infrastructure-work/article33523735.ece\\n',\n",

All the images she used for painting on the saree were so deeply rooted in the minds of the people that at a first glance, anyone could recognise the COVID-19 theme of her design.“I started the work out of curiosity in the peak of the lockdown. But when I completed the work, I could not believe myself that I had transferred a big message onto a global canvas,” she said. Her canvas was the extra-large sari specially made by the Kuthampully weavers.She chose each image after considering their lasting relevance. Begun with the infamous Wuhan market in China, where the COVID-19 originated, Ms. Sindhu went on to portray the initial travel of the virus to Italy, America and Britain.The panic caused by the Nizamuddin meet, the arrival of a few Malayali passengers from Italy, blocking of the road on Kerala-Karnataka border, passengers giving biscuits to tired policemen on COVID-19 duty, and a son in quarantine watching his father’s funeral on live video were some of the paintings she used from people’s recent memory about the pandemic.“I used Gateway of India to highlight Mumbai, because Mumbai had the highest number of cases when I was designing the sari,” she told The Hindu.Ms. Sindhu chose the image of a pregnant Earth wearing gloves and a mask to conclude her series of paintings. “It’s an indication of the precautions that we need to take if we want a healthy future for mother Earth and its children,” she said, describing her painting.She has carefully crafted her sari border also with COVID-19-related images. Masks, gloves, sanitisers, hand washes, and social distancing, are among those little images carefully crafted into the border.Recognition and records soon started coming Ms. Sindhu’s way. First it was the Best of India Record, followed by the India Book of Record, the Asia Book of Record, and of late the Golden Book of World Record.Textile giants have approached Ms. Sindhu for the sari, which she is keen to display at the Lalitha Kala Akademi at Thrissur. “I will be happy to donate whatever I get from this to the Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund,” she said.Sayed Abid Husain Thangal, MLA of Kottakkal, who visited her house on Thursday, was excited to see her work. “It is exceptional brilliance of Ms. Sindhu.

And today was not an exception. About 50 or so lawless people who breached the U.S. Capitol perimeter by climbing the walls, breaking the windows and attacking police inside this sacred temple to American Democracy is not a reason to throw the million-plus peaceful protestors under the bus,” he had written in the deleted post.Echoing Mr. Trump’s claims of electoral fraud, Mr. Palathingal wrote that he considered President Trump had afforded a tool to American patriots to start the cleaning up of the fraud prone system in many States.“If he had conceded, that is the end of the discussion. Then the Democrat fraudsters will ensure that the U.S. will slowly move to a one party system by stealing every election in the future. He didn’t do that in spite of tremendous pressure. That’s why I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump,” he had written.Mr. Palathingal also posted images of himself with the Indian national flag near the Capitol, along with other Trump supporters who laid siege to the Capitol.“Some criminals had infiltrated our event and incited the violence. It was a peaceful protest by one million people. All Trump rallies are fun. I do not regret the decision to take the Indian flag to the protest. I am a very proud Indo-American, who had supported Trump. Violence is not part of us,” he told The Hindu. Mr. Palathingal has been settled in the U.S. since 1992 after graduating in Civil Engineering from the Government Engineering College, Thrissur.A member of the State Central Committee of the Republican Party in Virginia, he said the Trump supporters were expecting the Congress to hold serious debate on the election fraud by making this unprecedented move at the Capitol. “We had expected about 12 hours of discussion, where all the proof on the rigged elections could have been presented. All that was thwarted because of the violence. After it, the Republican people did not support Trump as they feared losing their name,” he alleged.\\xa0Mr. Palathingal recalled that he was a Democrat before and had voted for Barack Obama twice. “I became an active member of the Republican Party in 2014-15 after getting disappointed by his socialist policies, which were not good for the U.S.,” he said.There was widespread criticism in social media following the post, with several comments against him, following which the post was taken down. Mr.Palathingal is an active commentator in social media on Kerala politics as well, with several posts criticising the LDF Government.Earlier, after a video of a person waving the tricolour from the Capitol went viral, BJP MP Varun Gandhi tweeted, “Why is there an Indian flag there??? This is one fight we definitely don’t need to participate in”. Replying to this, Shashi Tharoor MP tweeted -“Unfortunately, @varungandhi80, there are some Indians with the same mentality as that Trumpist mob, who enjoy using the flag as a weapon rather than a badge of pride, & denounce all who disagree with them as anti-nationals & traitors. That flag there is a warning to all of us.”Replying to both of them, Mr. Palathingal tweeted - “American patriots - Vietnamese, Indian, Korean & Iranian origins, & from so many other nations & races, who believe massive voter fraud has happened joined rally yesterday in solidarity with Trump. Peaceful protestors who were exercising our rights”.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:56:49 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/peaceful-protestors-exercising-our-rights-says-man-who-waved-tricolour-at-capitol-protest/article33529060.ece\\n',\n",

Community Kitchens were opened to provide food to the needy and it was ensured that Guest Workers got food of their choice.COVID-19 has considerably impeded the normal social life in the State. All countries in the world are facing the challenges posed by the pandemic in differing degrees. “Kerala has almost 9% of its population living abroad. The impact of the pandemic has been quite severe on the State economy. Kerala receives remittances from abroad to the tune of 12 per cent of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The coming back of around 6 lakh emigrants will hamper the flow of remittances and this will dampen the robust private consumption expenditure in the State”, he said.The Governor said a direct consequence of this is a downward slide in the economic growth of the State. Expert Committee has estimated the loss in GSDP for financial year 2020-21 at a phenomenal figure of ₹80,000 crore which is about 10% of the GSDP.The deep dent faced by the economy is bound to adversely affect the revenues at various levels. Kerala will face the double whammy of lower own tax revenue collections and reduction in devolution of Central taxes due to the economic down turn resulting from the pandemic. Along with reduced revenue inflows the expenditure burden has also gone up.The Governor said the Government has been taking proactive steps to mitigate the rigours of the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the various sectors of the economy. “ We are determined to revitalise our economy and make sure that adequate employment opportunities are generated for our people including persons who have been compelled to return from abroad leaving their jobs”, he said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:56:59 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-difficult-fiscal-scenario-faces-the-state-governors-address/article33527200.ece\\n',\n",

Vasu Jayaprakash, the executive director of Jatayupara Tourism Private Limited (JTPL), a company formed by the investors, along with other investors Ramesh Babu, Mathew P.J., Varkala Sathyan and Babu Cheruvallil accused Mr. Anchal of colluding with the Ecotourism Director, the nodal officer of the project, for their vested interests.“While there is a valid contract between JTPL and Guruchandrika Builders and Private Limited (company owned by Mr. Anchal that had entered into agreement with the government for the project), he has now sought to terminate the contract, despite it being devoid of a termination clause. While the illegal termination was challenged in the Commercial Court, Thiruvananthapuram, the nodal officer had labelled us strangers and hijackers of the project as well as the 65 acres of land allotted by the government for the project,” the group of NoRKs said.They also claimed that the court held that the legality of the termination of the agreement has to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, the contract between the parties will remain intact till then. They added that JTPL had allotted 45% of the equity shares, equivalent to ₹30.90 lakh to Mr. Anchal’s company, for signing the operational right agreement, despite the sculptor only making an investment of ₹10 lakh for the project.While the Jatayu project has been operational since 2018, the investors alleged that Mr. Anchal has been permitting entry for visitors without any proper ticketing system in a bid to misappropriate funds and deceive the government. “While the government has not intervened in the issue thus far, our plight could deter non-resident Indians (NRIs) from investing in any projects in the State,” they lamented. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:57:09 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nork-investors-cry-foul-over-jatayu-project/article33524009.ece\\n',\n",

You can subscribe for free hereFor Sean, played by Shia LaBeouf, the urgency to finish the bridge is driven by his desire to make sure his daughter is the first person to cross it. Sean is a former addict but his intentions are rather simple and straightforward; so much so that he seldom feels the need to hide them from others. He nudges his co-workers to speed up the work citing the promise he’s made his daughter.In stark contrast, Sean’s partner Martha, played by Vanessa Kirby, responds perfunctorily to her colleagues’ questions about her pregnancy. A woman of layers, Martha’s world is not as unsophisticated as Sean’s. In her pursuit to accord maximum authority to the baby, Martha has opted for home labour instead of going to a hospital so that ‘her baby gets to choose when she wants to come.’These portions, presented as brief scenes filmed in long takes, fade in comparison to the prolonged sequence depicting Martha’s labour proceedings. The 24-minute long sequence, appearing as a single shot, plays out like a symphony between the actors and the camera. The camera glides and swivels, inside rooms and across people, resembling a ball dance. And as the visuals become occasionally gruesome, the proceedings even exhibit flashes of a thriller.Pieces of a WomanDirector: Kornél MundruczóCast: Vanessa Kirby, Shia LaBeouf, Ellen Burstyn, Molly ParkerPlot: The lives of a couple awaiting the delivery of their first child is taken by storm after an unexpected eventSoon the dust settles, and the narrative comes into its own: a drama about trauma and coping. It showcases a tragedy and the effects it can have on the people who underwent it collectively. It also traces the diverse paths these people take in their pursuit of closure, bringing to the fore their contrasting character traits yet again.Sean has come to terms with the tragedy and is now out seeking answers from others, but to no avail. He grows frustrated and relapses. However, Martha, waging a personal battle, is confident that the solution to her problems has to come from within. Despite their best intentions, their lives have taken such varied trajectories, such that their best efforts have ceased to be enough for each other.Kirby, who won a Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival for the film, gives a devastating and fully realised performance as a woman whose life and marriage is in turmoil after dealing with an unexpected loss. The supporting cast, including Shia LaBeouf and Ellen Burstyn, complement her beautifully.Ultimately, Pieces of a Woman serves as a reminder that oftentimes, closure may hold different meanings for different people – partner, family and society. And it may come in different forms.Pieces of a Woman is currently streaming on Netflix\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:57:13 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pieces-of-a-woman-movie-review-in-pursuit-of-closure/article33529628.ece\\n\",\n",

The movie was originally about the danger of Trump and Trumpism.“What coronavirus demonstrated was that there’s a lethal effect to his spreading of lies and conspiracy theories.

When you look back at your career, is there anything you would change? Once she was known as the wife of the late Kannada veteran Lokesh. Today, she is known as the mother of popular actor and television presenter, Srujan Lokesh. But Girija Lokesh has always held her own, despite the spotlight shining brightly on her family. She has no complaints whatsoever: “It’s a sheer joy that my children are also doing so well,” she says, over phone from Bengaluru.The actor, who has acted in films such as Kakana Kote, Halli Meshtru and Bhoteyyana Mommaga Ayyu, has bowled over fans and critics with her acting prowess, over the years. She is also the recipient of the Rajyotsava Award in 2013 for her contribution to Kannada cinema. The soon-to-be septuagenarian looks back at her career. Edited excerpts:  That happened when my father incurred a terrible loss in his business. Like every other child, I too had learnt music and dance. Those learnings paved the way for my life. I would earn ₹7 or ₹15 for every dance class. We were five children and we could survive an entire month with that amount. I was 15 when I stepped into the world of performing arts and never dreamt that I would make a livelihood from acting, as I had no background in theatre or films. No, never. In fact, I was not even scared when I faced the camera for the first time. But what scared me was the strange sound that the camera would make every time it was on. And since there were film reels then, I would also freak out every time I made a mistake or forgot my lines. Because, the reels would go waste and that would lead to a loss.  It was such a life changing experience. I was always thrilled to work with him; he was such a great actor. And every opportunity that I got to work with him, I saw him in a different light. He had the ability to surrender himself to the character, which still sends chills down my spine.And there was a lot of playfulness too. When people praised me for my acting, which was a rarity, I would bully him and walk around with a halo (laughs).  That needs to be done. It can’t be done by one person. This has to be done so that the works of greats like Puttanna Kanagal will reach the masses. The directors, stars, and the industry should work towards preserving classics.  No. I have had a good journey. I live each moment in the present. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:55:01 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/girija-lokesh-gives-us-a-peek-into-her-past/article33524645.ece\\n',\n",

There is talk of a likely impact on the party due to the expected release of former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala from a Bengaluru prison later this month. However, several functionaries of the party said the Sasikala factor is unlikely to figure in the meeting. The general council is expected to authorise Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister and party coordinator O. Panneerselvam to decide the seat-sharing arrangements with other parties during the Assembly election. Some of them refer to the recent “authoritative statement” of the Chief Minister that Ms. Sasikala’s release will not have any impact on the party. Not many are expecting a rapprochement between the camp of the present leadership and that of Ms. Sasikala any time soon. But a senior office-bearer said there was a possibility of the former Chief Minister’s aide backing the idea of the AIADMK and the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) working together to defeat the “common enemy” – the DMK – in the election. Another ruling party office-bearer said there was a perception in the party that the AMMK had toned down its criticism of the Union government in recent times. Around 4,500 people have been invited to the meeting. About 2,300 members of the general council and 320 members of the executive are among the invitees. In addition, a large number of office-bearers of rural local bodies and various associate bodies, all called special invitees, are expected to attend the meeting.  Apart from resolutions on a host of matters, key office-bearers, including deputy co-ordinators K.P. Munusamy and R. Vathilingam, are expected to address the meeting of the general council. “No fireworks are likely. We expect it to be a smooth meeting,” the office-bearers said, and added that the council may ratify the nomination of Mr. Palaniswami as the Chief Minister candidate and the constitution of the 11-member steering committee. The previous meeting of the council took place in November 2019 when the party amended bylaws on the eligibility of candidates for contesting in the organisational poll for posts, including that of coordinator and co-coordinator. The stipulation of “uninterrupted duration of membership” for five years was reiterated. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:57:29 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-general-council-meets-today/article33532371.ece\\n',\n",

It was entirely funded by the government, the judge observed.The judge said the school no doubt had been treated as a private school under the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973. The staff were not government servants. But, the fact remained that it was managed by the Revenue Department/district administration.The school came within the ambit of Section 2(c) of the 2020 Act that defined government schools and students who had studied in government schools as it was managed by a ‘government department’, the judge said.The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on Preferential basis to Students of Government Schools Act, 2020, was enacted to extend the benefit of reservation to economically disadvantaged students. The definition under the Act would have to receive a purposive construction.Taking note of the fact that the High Court had earlier directed the authorities to consider the candidate for admission to MBBS course, and subsequently the candidate had secured a seat at Government Sivagangai Medical College, the seat allocation in his favour was made absolute, the judge said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:57:35 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/medical-aspirant-secures-seat-on-courts-direction-madurai-high-court-thanjavur-sivaganga/article33531524.ece\\n',\n",

Shortly after meeting the Chief Minister, Dr. Vardhan told reporters, “We have asked the Chief Minister to specifically focus a little more on TB elimination. We have asked some States that have the potential and capability to eliminate TB by 2025, five years ahead of the international goals. I hope Tamil Nadu could be one of those States and examples like this can be showcased to the rest of the country. They can also emulate the example of Tamil Nadu,” he said. The Union Health Minister, however, did not specify when the COVID-19 vaccines would be rolled out. To a question on when the first batch of vaccines would be rolled out, he said all the preparations such as trial runs were happening as the vaccine has to ultimately be rolled out one day. “You will get to know as soon as the date is decided,” he said.He said he had conveyed his appreciation [to the State] for providing exemplary services on the health front in particular. “Various facts that we noticed including the performance of 100% RT-PCR tests, providing good quality facilities for treatment of patients even in the government sector and also institutionalising post-COVID care sequelae and research around that. I had come to Tamil Nadu to oversee arrangements being made for impending vaccination against COVID-19,” he said. He noted that he inspected three vaccination sites in the government and private sector, and central stores where the vaccines would be stored for distribution to most of the southern States. “We also requested the CM for attention on the health and wellness centres. Our aim is to create 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres focussing on preventive, promotive and positive health in all parts of the country by the end of 2022,” he said. Dr. Vardhan recalled that the Centre had sanctioned 11 new government medical colleges for the State. “In 2019, the Cabinet had decided to have 75 more medical colleges converted from district hospitals in the country. All 75 have been decided, and 11 medical colleges were allotted to Tamil Nadu, and we laid the foundation stone for a few of them in the beginning of 2020.

Mr. Vasan, who was chairing the zonal meeting of the party, said the TMC was an important ally of the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and it would strive hard to ensure the victory of the ruling party and other alliance partners in the coming Assembly elections. “We are also gearing up for the election and would secure seats to match our strength,” he said. Asked whether the TMC would contest on its own symbol or on the AIADMK’s symbol, Mr. Vasan said a political party contesting on its own symbol was not a problem in the AIADMK alliance. “The issue is a problem only in the DMK alliance,” he contended. Mr. Vasan said DMK president M.K. Stalin should prepare for a debate [on corruption charges] with Chief Minister Edappadi K.

The Opposition leader should follow constructive politics without creating any unnecessary problems,” he said. Mr. Vasan alleged that the farmers’ protest in Delhi could not come to an end because of the Opposition parties. “Farmers should at least now wake up to the reality and make use of the next round of talks to find a solution,” he said.

As the group moved into the interior, nearly 70 km away from its entry point, tense situation prevailed in villages in Karvetinagram and Puttur ranges, as jumbo presence is unheard of in the region so far. The three tuskers emerging from the Tamil Nadu forests crossed Gudiyattam (Tamil Nadu), Yadamarri, Gudipala, Chittoor and S.R. Puram mandals, before entering the Karvetinagaram range, which holds very thin vegetation, considered unsuited for wild elephants. Interestingly, except for foraying into the fields occasionally, the group is confining itself mostly to hillocks. Having advanced into the densely populated areas with denuded jungle cover, the herd is moving forward, without showing any sign of making a retreat into its habitation. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor East Wildlife) G.G. Narentheran, who is monitoring the situation with about 25 forest watchers, told The Hindu that the situation required more caution. “It’s not that easy to drive the herd back into its habitation after it strayed several kilometres. Our men are cautiously handling the situtation. Fortunately, due to heavy rains since six months, there is a lot of grass and considerable fodder in the forests. The herd is able to sustain on them, not creating much trouble for the farmers,” he said.Referring to the options of capturing the animals if the situation went out of control, the DFO said that such an action required the permission from the Central authorities. “Even if we want to go for a ‘kumki’ operation (by trained elephants) to drive the herd into the thickets, it does not sound workable as its habitation is at least 40 km away. On the positive side, the Bachelor’s Group’s (an adult male member leading juvenile animal) is not menacing like regular herds or lone elephants. We are sure to handle the issue smoothly,” Mr. Narentheran said.Forest personnel at Karvetinagaram said the three-member group is currently camping close to Ammapalle hamlet near Krishnapuram reservoir. “We are taking all precautionary measures to stop the herd’s movement towards Puttur range, a plain area. Similarly, a vigil is mounted on the Vedurukuppam road. We have widely arranged tom-tom urging people in the vulnerable areas not to wear white clothes and move close to the animals. As the farmers here are not used to the presence of jumbos, we have instructed them to avoid night vigils till the crisis is over,” G. Sivanna, Forest Range Officer, said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:57:59 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bachelors-group-of-jumbos-keeps-chittoor-villages-on-edge/article33523553.ece\\n',\n",

The first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the Registry to list the cases after four weeks for further hearing. Though the petitioners’ counsel urged the court to stay the EC’s decision, the Bench said that any order on the issue could be passed only after hearing the counsel for the respondents. Senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, pointed out that the party had challenged the constitutional validity of Section 60(c) of the Representation of the People Act of 1951 which empowers the ECI, in consultation with the government, to create a new class of voters and permit them to exercise their franchise through postal ballot instead of casting votes at polling booths. The counsel contended that the legal provision violates the right to secrecy in voting since postal ballots do not guarantee as much secrecy as Electronic Voting Machines do. Stating that secrecy in voting was a sine qua non for ensuring free and fair elections, he said the executive could not be allowed to exercise unbridled power on the issue of granting exemption from visiting polling booths. Mr. Wilson also pointed out that political parties do not get a chance to audit postal votes unlike the procedure of appointing booth agents to verify the genuineness of voters in polling booths. Stating that persons employed in essential services too had been given the option of postal ballot, he said the term essential services had not been defined clearly. “The ECI can call any service as essential service,” he said and stated that there was no rationale behind providing postal ballot facility to voters above 80 years of age when any one above 65 years was categorised as a senior citizen for all other official purposes. The extent of disability had also not been prescribed for permitting the differently abled to vote through postal ballot, he said. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:09 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-notice-to-centre-eci-over-postal-ballots/article33524128.ece\\n',\n",

A scene at Thirumangalam.\\n\\xa0 | Photo Credit: PICHUMANI K It's only a week into January. But Chennai has already recorded the decade’s highest rainfall for the month. Many other weather stations across the State too received a heavy downpour on Wednesday night. With the Northeast monsoon activity intensifying over the State, the Meteorological Department has forecast widespread rainfall to continue in most parts till January 13. On Friday, one or two places in 14 districts, including Coimbatore, Tiruvarur and Madurai, may receive heavy rain. The intensity is likely to go up to very high rainfall in some places on January 10. During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Thursday, Me.Mathur in Cuddalore district and Natham in Dindigul district recorded the day’s highest rainfall of 21cm each. Several other places too recorded heavy to very heavy rain. Officials of the Meteorological Department said a cyclonic circulation over south Tamil Nadu coast and neighbourhood also influenced the rain spell. However, easterly waves were the major reason behind the incessant downpour. Many districts had already accumulated massive amounts of rainfall within the first seven days of the month. The rainfall surplus in percentage runs into thousands in many districts. For instance, Chengalpattu district has recorded 16cm, which is 3,684% more than the monthly average of 4.2 mm for January. The weather station in Nungambakkam has already recorded 16.1cm of rain against its monthly average of nearly 3cm. Similarly, Meenambakkam has registered nearly 23cm of rain so far this month. This is the decade’s highest rainfall during January in the city. Last year, Chennai recorded 7cm of rainfall in January, officials noted. S.Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the moisture-laden easterly winds convergence over land largely led to such heavy rainfall. “We have had instances in the past when the NE monsoon had extended till January 18. But what made this January wet spell special is the intensity of rainfall and more coverage,” he said. La Nina conditions, a global weather phenomenon that refers to cooler sea surface temperatures over Pacific Ocean, had its effects over the NE monsoon spillover to January in the region. It had a tendency to prolong the monsoon after the official end of the season in December. “Weather models are now indicating that the rainspell may extend till the third week of January. However, its intensity may vary,” he said.The Meteorological Department forecasts moderate rainfall to occur in some areas of Chennai till Saturday and the maximum temperature will be around 29 degree Celsius. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:19 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/widespread-rain-to-continue-over-tn-for-next-five-days/article33524059.ece\\n\",\n",

Stalin for demanding the withdrawal of a case in the Supreme Court as a condition to participate in an open debate on the corruption charges levelled by the latter against him and a few Ministers. Addressing an election campaign titled ‘Vetrinadai Podum Tamizhagam’ (Tamil Nadu marches on successfully) in Arachalur, he said the Opposition leader had levelled corruption charges against him and the AIADMK government, and, hence, he had invited him for an open debate. “But now, he wants the case in the top court to be withdrawn for participating in the debate,” he said, adding, “Don’t give excuses. Say that you cannot come for the debate.”Mr. Palaniswami contended that the Supreme Court had stayed the Madras High Court order, allowing the CBI to conduct inquiries into allegations against him, as the charges were found to be untrue. “Let the debate take place and then the people can decide.” He said during the erstwhile DMK rule, a tender was floated for ₹200 crore to construct the new Secretariat building. But the contractor was paid ₹430 crore. “It is corruption, and if we point this out, Stalin gets angry,” he said.He criticised Mr. Stalin for questioning the Amma Mini Clinics’ scheme, when the whole nation was appreciating it. “When the country appreciates a scheme, Mr. Stalin opposes it,” he said, adding that only doctors provide treatment at the clinics. “If he has doubts, he can check with the doctors,” he said. The Chief Minister said the government was providing post-matric scholarships, of ₹1,500 crore, every year, to students, and it had also arranged bank loans worth ₹80,000 crore to 1.07 crore women members of self-help groups in the State.He said the government had provided free rice and essentials to those whose livelihoods had been affected by the pandemic. Besides, a Pongal gift hamper, comprising ₹2,500 cash, was being given to all ration rice cardholders to enable them to celebrate the festival. “But Mr. Stalin says the government has done nothing for the people. If he does not know, let him know from his partymen,” he addedAt Chithode, he said starting and upgrading of schools and launching of new colleges had helped the State improve its Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education, from 32% in 2011 to the present 49%.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:22 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-criticises-stalin-for-setting-terms-for-debate/article33524028.ece\\n',\n",

Of them, the CBI arrested K. Arulanantham, 34, of Vadugapalayam, who was the AIADMK Pollachi town students’ wing secretary (since expelled); Haron Paul, 29, of Achipatty; and P. Babu alias ‘Bike’ Babu, 27, on Tuesday. K. Thirunavukkarasu, 28; N. Rishwanth alias Sabarirajan, 26; M. Sathish, 30; T. Vasanthakumar, 25; and R.

Stalin said the ruling party had protected its local student wing leader till he was arrested by the CBI. Social media was now full of reports and photographs of him with Ministers and other AIADMK leaders, he added.“It is clear that there are a lot more people involved than those already arrested. Though the AIADMK has expelled student wing leader Arulanantham, there are others who are being shielded by the AIADMK. [In 2019] Forty eight hours after one Thirunavukkarasu had released a video accusing the government of making him and others scapegoats in the case, he was arrested,” Mr. Stalin said. He said his party would not rest till all those who were behind the case were arrested and brought to justice.The DMK’s youth wing also pasted posters against the AIADMK in Pollachi.The All India Democratic Women’s Association also demanded a fair probe.

Nearly two years had passed since the TRS made an election promise to give ₹3,000 unemployment allowance to the jobless youth, he said, adding that the State government had owed ₹72,000 employment allowance to each unemployed youth in the State for 24 months.Mr Sanjay accompanied by party general secretary and the Telangana State in-charge Tarun Chugh addressed a series of meetings with intellectuals, office-bearers of the party district committee and party functionaries here on Friday.

The reforms included notification of floor rates of property tax in the ULBs in consonance with the prevailing circle rates as also notify floor rates of user charges in respect of the provision of water supply, drainage and sewerage reflecting current costs/past inflation. In addition, the State had agreed to put in place a system of periodic increase in floor rates of property tax/user charges in line with price increases. By implementing the reforms, Telangana became the third State after Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to implement the urban local body reform. In the process, the State had become eligible for additional borrowing of ₹7,406 crore. The Central government, in May last year, enhanced the borrowing limit of the States by 2% of their Gross State Domestic Product. Half of the special dispensation was linked to undertaking reforms in four key areas. These are implementation of one nation one ration card, ease of doing business (EODB), urban local bodies reforms and power sector reforms. The State was the first in implementing one nation one ration card system while it competes with neighbouring AP and Uttar Pradesh in EODB parameters. It has now joined the ranks of AP and MP in ULB reforms. Doubts however persist on the implementation of the reform suggested in the power sector as it would entail privatisation of the distribution companies. The State voiced its concern over the proposed reforms as it would have an adverse impact on the agriculture sector for which the government is providing power free of cost on 24x7 basis. Implementation of the last reform would enable the State to get permission for mobilising another ₹2,500 crore (0.25% of GSDP) through open market borrowings, but it would depend on whether the State opts for reforms in the power sector as suggested by the Centre in the coming days.According to the Union Finance Ministry, 10 States implemented one nation one ration card so far and seven put in place EODB norms. The total additional borrowing permission issued to these States which implemented reforms was ₹54,190 crore.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:54 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/state-successfully-implements-urban-local-body-reform/article33523831.ece\\n',\n",

Photo: Twitter/@DilipGhoshBJP\\n\\xa0 A ruckus broke out at the mega rally of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district on Friday. Stones were hurled, barricades were breached and agitated supporters shouted slogans directed at the party leadership. The meeting, where senior BJP leaders Kaliash Vijayvargiya, Dilip Ghosh, Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari were present had to be hurriedly called off. The meeting was a show of strength of BJP leadership particularly former Trinamool Congress Minister and Nandigram strongman Suvendu Adhikari who joined BJP last month. The BJP leadership blamed the Trinamool Congress for inciting trouble at the rally by throwing stones. Mr Adhikari said that he had never faced such a situation in his political career and said that even the supporters of Communist Party of India (Marxist) never disrupted any public meetings of the Trinamool Congress. The people who had raised slogans said that their anger was about the possibility of other Trinamool leaders joining the BJP. The State unit of the BJP has been facing dissent and sometimes protests with the Trinamool leaders joining the party. Another highlight of the rally was the presence of family members of those killed in police firing in Nandigram in March 2007. 14 persons were killed in the police firing when the Nandigram had turned violent during agitation forcible land acquisition. “ I will thank the members of martyr families who joined us today. Out of 41 families 30 families have come to the BJP stage today,” Mr Adhikari said. He also spoke about the contribution of BJP leaders particularly Lal Krishna Advani to the Nandigram movement. TMC was an ally of the BJP in 2007 and a BJP delegation comprising senior leaders had visited Nandigram after the police firing. The BJP leadership also accused the Trinamool Congress of betraying the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA). Speaking at the venue Mr Vijayvargiya said that none of the police officers responsible for firing in Nandigram are not behind bars. The BJP leaders said that while one officer has joined the TMC after retirement another officer is closely working with the Chief Minister. The Trinamool Congress leadership, which has challenged Mr Adhikari to seek a reelection from the Nandigram Assembly seat after he switched sides, will hold a public meeting in Nandigram on January 18. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:58 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ruckus-at-bjp-rally-in-nandigram/article33532121.ece\\n',\n",

Amarinder should have been in the forefront of the fight to secure the rights of the farmers of the State. You (Capt. Amarinder) should have led the agitation and even been ready to sacrifice all for it. Instead, you are only giving lip sympathy to farmers,” said Mr. Badal, addressing a press conference in Jalandhar.Mr. Badal accused the Chief Minister for failing to rescind the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act (APMC), which was amended by him in 2017 and which contained all the provisions of the three farm laws.“Presently the situation was such that even if the Centre repealed the three laws they would still be applicable in Punjab as the Congress government had refused to take back the changes made in its APMC Act,” alleged Mr. Badal.Separately in a statement, former Union Minister and Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal said Capt. Amarinder should tell people about how much longer he would wait before exercising legal options to ensure the three agricultural Bills, passed unanimously in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha to counter the ill effects of the Centre farm laws, were forwarded to the President for assent by the Governor of Punjab.Mrs. Badal said the go-slow policy adopted by the Chief Minister in pursuing the three Bills passed by State Assembly clearly indicated that he was deliberately delaying action on the issue.“The Chief Minister should spell out what legal options you have taken since the last 80 days, when the bills were passed in the State Assembly, to ensure justice is done to the farmers of Punjab in the case. If you have done nothing, which is the case, you should explain why you have failed the farmers of Punjab yet again,” she added.Captain Amarinder, however, responded by saying Mr. Badal and Ms. Harsimrat Kaur had been giving contradictory statements on the Governor’s assent issue, terming it “a classic case of Charles Darwin’s missing link, which the Akalis seem to be suffering from.”On Mr Badal’s claim that the resolutions passed in the Punjab Assembly against the three farm laws had not been sent to the Governor, Capt. Amarinder said the Shiromani Akali Dal president had clearly lost it.“Or perhaps he is suffering from serious amnesia since his party colleagues, including his own brother-in-law Bikram Majithia, had accompanied me to the Governor’s House for submitting the resolution and the three State Amendment Bills,” said Capt.

This decision should be reconsidered. The Maratha quota case is being heard by a five-member Bench, which cannot overrule the verdict of a nine-member Bench,” the Congress leader told reporters.Besides capping overall reservations, the Supreme Court in Indira Sawhney vs Union of India also laid down that economic backwardness alone can not be a criterion for quota.The apex court has stayed the 16% quota for Marathas in education and jobs in Maharashtra. If the quota comes into effect, the total reservation in the State will exceed 50%.Mr. Chavan, a senior Congress leader, also demanded that as in the case of reservations in Tamil Nadu (which exceeded 50%), the Union government should intervene and give “constitutional protection” to the Maratha quota. “If the Maratha quota is upheld, the issue of reservation in several other States will be resolved,” Mr. Chavan said. He will request Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue, he added.As the hearing in the Supreme Court will begin from January 25, the Cabinet sub-committee will hold a meeting with the State’s legal team in Delhi on January 11, he said.

According to sources, the defection of Vasant Gite, a former MLA from the Nashik Central Assembly seat, and Sunil Bagul is expected to weaken the BJP’s influence in the Nashik civic body, which goes to the polls in 2022. Dubbing their return as “a homecoming of old Shiv Sainiks”, Sena MP and spokesman Sanjay Raut, who presided over Mr. Gite and Mr. Bagul’s entry to the party fold in Nashik, claimed that several more BJP leaders were on their way to joining the Sena. “The political winds are changing in Nashik…the next Mayor will be from the Shiv Sena,” said Mr. Raut. Remarking that it was important for the duo’s ‘homecoming’ ceremony to be held in Nashik, Mr. Raut further said that both leaders met Shiv Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray at the latter’s official residence ‘Varsha’ earlier this week. Mr. Gite and Mr. Bagul will be formally inducted into the Sena in the presence of Mr. Thackeray at a function at the Thackeray family residence ‘Matoshree’ later on Friday. Mr. Gite had also been the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)’s point man in Nashik before his defection to the BJP in 2014.

Last month, during a virtual meeting with faculty members, the VC made a claim that he had received a call from Professor Sen, who introduced himself as “Bharat Ratna Amartya Sen” and requested that hawkers outside his Santiniketan home not be evicted. Subsequently, the VBUFA president emailed Professor Sen, who denied making any such call.When the university reiterated that the Nobel laureate had indeed called the VC and even pinpointed the time the call was made — in June 2019 — Professor Bhattacharyya once again wrote to the Nobel laureate, who rubbished the claim as “tantalisingly untrue”.Following this unpleasant publicity, it was expected that disciplinary action would be taken against Professor Bhattacharyya sooner than later. He is now said to be preparing to challenge his suspension in the Calcutta High Court.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:59:19 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/visva-bharati-places-popular-critic-of-vc-under-suspension/article33528207.ece\\n',\n",

It has been learnt the notice was sent earlier this week and the board plans to run its premier tournament with its own set of professionals from this year. The UK-based company had retained the event rights for the IPL in 2017 for a five-year period till 2022. The 2021 edition is expected to be held in its usual window of March-April but it is not yet decided whether it will take place in India or overseas like the 2020 one. A mini auction before the IPL is expected to be held in February. The latest edition, which ran from September-November, was held in the UAE due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a bio-secure environment. It was the second time in IPL history that the tournament was held overseas completely (after South Africa in 2009). \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:59:42 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-decides-to-part-ways-with-img/article33529811.ece\\n',\n",

It was one of my best run-outs. Having got the direct hit from outside the 30-yard circle, I would say it’s my most favourite, in fact the best,” Jadeja said.“Picking up wickets — three or four — overseas is good, but the run-out was a moment that will stay with me forever,” he said.Jadeja’s amazing effort in the field — running in from the deep square-leg boundary, picking the ball up with one hand and dismantling the woodwork with a rocket throw before Smith completed a second run — brought an end to Australia’s first innings.Having bowled just three overs on the first day, Jadeja yet again displayed his utility as an all-rounder.Asked whether he was increasingly looking at himself as a genuine all-rounder in Test cricket over the last year or year-and-a-half, Jadeja said: “It’s not about the last 12 or 18 months, but whenever I get an opportunity, I am keen on contributing with the bat and the ball. Ever since I started playing, that’s been my role.“Whenever presented with an opportunity, I have delivered as an all-rounder. When you score runs overseas, it gets highlighted more. I don’t think too much about the past but am focused on converting whatever opportunities I get.”\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:59:45 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-can-rewind-and-play-this-smith-run-out-my-best-ever-ravindra-jadeja/article33528875.ece\\n',\n",

I just tried to be a bit faster on my feet, especially against the spinners. I tried to come down the wicket and play off the back foot a bit better, but nothing different against the quicks.”The former Australia captain said he made a concerted effort to be more aggressive against R. Ashwin, particularly after being dismissed by the off-spinner twice in the last three innings.“I decided to be a bit more positive. Early on, I hit him over his head to put pressure on him, to make him bowl where I wanted to. It was a concerted effort to do that, so happy with the way I played him,” Smith added.Over the last few years, teams have come up with specific plans to keep Smith quiet, with India using a heavy leg-side field in the first two matches. When asked about it, the 31-year-old conceded that he has had to work hard to score runs in recent years.“I think the plans have been different. I feel in a way less likely to get out but harder to score. That’s probably shown in a few games over the last few years. With the fields they are setting and the way they are bowling, I have had to work hard for my runs. But this game I was aggressive early and tried to put it back on the bowlers a bit more. I got close to a run a ball for my first 20 runs and got myself going. After that, it was just about absorbing the pressure and putting the pressure when you need to,” Smith added.“I think it is a decent total. The wicket is a bit up and down as we have seen. Hopefully, we can start well in the morning and build some pressure.”India vs Australia third Test live (5 a.m. onwards) on Sony Ten 1, 3 and Sony Six.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:59:47 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aus-vs-ind-third-test-being-faster-on-feet-putting-concerted-pressure-on-ashwin-worked-says-steve-smith/article33528837.ece\\n',\n",

The lockdown was announced less than 24 hours after top cricket board officials from India and Australia were engaged in a discussion on relaxation of hard quarantine measures for the visitors. “Cricket Australia executives are urgently trying to determine the impact of a three-day lockdown in Brisbane on next week's fourth Test at the Gabba, which was already under a cloud because of India’s hesitation to fly north and be subjected to tighter bio-security restrictions,” the newspaper reported.“A hotel quarantine worker’s positive test to the more contagious U.K. strain of COVID-19 is the latest spanner in the works for CA’s hopes to close out the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series at the Gabba,” it further wrote. While Cricket Australia were ready to allow a capacity crowd of 36,000, the fluid health situation might warrant a change in the spectator policy.“The health scare in the city, however, has left those attendance caps in jeopardy,” the newspaper stated. On Thursday, The BCCI wrote to CA seeking relaxation in hard quarantine protocol of Brisbane, reminding the host board that the visitors are done with the strict isolation that was agreed upon at the beginning of the tour. The quarantine rules in Brisbane will restrict the players to just their hotel rooms after day's play. CA has already verbally assured the Indians that “a deal” has been “signed off on by the Queensland government to allow players and staff out of their rooms to mingle together inside the hotel when not playing or training will remain in place for their week in the city.” However, it is learnt that BCCI wants a written assurance on the matter.

Marnus Labuschagne made 91 and Will Pucovski 62 on debut.India's openers negotiated a tricky nine overs before tea to be 26 without loss, and they put on another 44 before Hazlewood struck, removing Rohit for 26. Rohit hadn't played since straining a hamstring in October and only joined the team last week after spending a fortnight in quarantine.But he quickly shook off the rust, hitting a big six off Nathan Lyon before surviving a scare on 24, when he was given out before the decision was reversed on review. His reprieve proved short-lived, however, making just two more before being caught and bowled.At the other end Gill, who made 45 and 35 not out on debut in Melbourne, again showed composure and skill, reinforcing his status as a potential long-term opener. Just 21, he brought up a maiden Test half-century before nicking an edge to Cameron Green off Cummins.It left Pujara and Rahane to dig in and see India safely to stumps as the runs dried up.Smith, who averages more than 61, failed to reach double figures in the first two Tests but roared back to life on his home ground, reaching his ton off 201 balls. He survived an ambitious lbw review on 41 before bringing up a patient century then letting rip, adding a quickfire 31 before being run out by Jadeja's fabulous direct hit.Meanwhile, Labuschagne came up with a typically gritty innings on a ground where he scored 215 this time last year against New Zealand. But as he closed in on a fifth Test century, he was bamboozled by a Jadeja ball that took extra bounce, thick-edging it to Rahane at slip.Smith brought up a 30th Test half-century before light rain set in.Wickets tumbleOn their return from 24 minutes off the field, following an earlier eight-minute break, Matthew Wade was undone by his natural aggression, recklessly skying a Jadeja ball to Bumrah.Green went without scoring, trapped lbw by Bumrah who then clattered the stumps of Tim Paine (1).

Sathyamoorthy  Highlighting the harmonious relationships between the different indigenous groups of the Nilgiris, N. Ram, director, The Hindu Group of Publications, said that such unity proved that communalism would not work as a political mobilisation strategy in south India. Speaking at an event to release the special calendar on ‘Indigenous Badagars of the Nilgiris’ organized by the Nilgiri Documentation Centre in Udhagamandalam on Friday, Mr. Ram said that there were many “attractive features in the social life of the Badagas,” including basic equality between men and women in the community and the fact that there was no dowry system. Stating that communalism was being used by Hindutva groups as a political mobilisation strategy in other parts of India, Mr. Ram said that there was no chance for such ideologies to take root in southern India. “The Badagas have had good relationships with other communities who live in the district, such as the Todas and the Kotas,” he said. Nilgiris MP, A. Raja, who was another special guest at the event, said that the Badagas of the district had had progressive laws within their communities for hundreds of years prior to the introduction of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence in India. “When Babasaheb Ambedkar tried to introduce the Hindu Code in the 1950s, he was defeated in his efforts to ensure that women had the right to divorce, right to adopt and the right to inherit. However, the Badagas have had these progressive laws in their community for thousands of years,” said Mr. Raja, who spoke of the “uniqueness” of the Dravidian family of languages, and quoted C.N. Annadurai’s maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha in 1962. “I belong to the Dravidian stock. I am proud to call myself a Dravidian. That does not mean that I am against a Bengali or a Maharashtrian or a Gujarati…I say that I belong to the Dravidian stock and that is only because I consider that the Dravidians have got something concrete, something distinct, something different to offer to the nation at large,” he said quoting Mr. Annadurai. Venugopal Dharmalingam, honorary director of the Nilgiri Documentation Centre (NDC), spoke of the history of the Badagas as well as of John Sullivan, considered to be the founder of the modern Nilgiris. “The Badagas have been vilified by claims over the last 200 years that we are from Mysore. The NDC has been working for many decades to dispel these false claims and misconceptions,” said Mr. Dharmalingam. He also added that the NDC has played a vital role in highlighting the contributions of he colonial administrators of the district, such as John Sullivan, and W.G. McIvor, the founder of the Government Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam. Mr. Dharmalingam said that the Badagas have been demanding that they be included among the list of Scheduled Tribe communities in Tamil Nadu, and said that the community had been added to the United Nations’ International Mountain Partnership, which will help in the protection of the Nilgiris and support their claims for inclusion into the list of Scheduled Tribe communities. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:00:03 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/unity-among-nilgiris-communities-proves-communalism-will-not-work-as-political-mobilization-strategy-in-south-says-n-ram/article33528451.ece\\n',\n",

On Wednesday, State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat lashed out at the Director General of Information and Public Relations Department, which comes under Mr. Thackeray, for using Sambhajinagar when there was no official notification of renaming Auranagabad. The tweets on Thursday were about the State Cabinet’s decision to regularise land. In the first tweet, Mr. Thackeray said that he had promised this to residents of Sambhajinagar which he fulfilled, while in the second, he said that this decision would fulfil the dreams of residents of Sambhajinagar known as the capital of the Marathwada region. The CMO’s tweets, irrespective of the Congress’s opposition, are seen as the Sena’s firm stand on renaming Aurangabad. The Sena, Congress and NCP are partners in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation is set to go to polls in coming months and the renaming row is likely to be escalated. Earlier in the day, Deputy Chief Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said that the issue would be sorted out through discussions. “This is a tripartite government and we have decided on a common minimum programme. Issues can arise as three parties are running the government. We will sit together and find a way out of it through talks,” Mr. Pawar said.Mr. Thorat on Wednesday said that the MVA government worked on the CMP and constitutional values were part of it. “We will oppose any renaming of city if social harmony is going to be disturbed.

Irrigation Department has been tasked with removing water hyacinths in the Okhla barrage by March 31.The decomposition of water hyacinths releases surfactants, like phosphates, which leads to frothing.The DJB has to connect all unauthorised colonies and settlements to its sewerage system by December 31 next year.Till then, the utility has to ensure that the sewage and septic tank waste from such colonies is collected and transported to sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment plants by authorised vendors – which is an ongoing exercise.The water utility has to upgrade its existing STPs to meet the prescribed standards of the DPCC by the end of next year.The construction of new STPs at Coronation Pillar and Okhla has to be completed by June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The two STPs will be able to treat 70 MGD and 124 MGD (million gallons of wastewater per day), respectively.All drain-owning agencies, including DJB, DDA, MCDs and PWD, have to impose environmental compensation of ₹50,000 on those who dump solid waste and sewage into drains.The DDA has to remove all encroachments, including dhobi ghats, if any, from the Yamuna floodplains by March 31, according to the action plan.“Foam formation in the Yamuna is due to the presence of phosphates and surfactants in the river.

Currently there is a great deal of churning going on in the country and the way in which humanity was ending is being arrested through this movement. Farmers are the backbone of this country and what is the point of forcing something on us which we do not want?”Stating that agitations against several issues would follow, Mr. Singh said, “Aab Inquilab aayegi” [There will be revolution now] and now it will not stop at only farmers’ issues. The only good thing that the Prime Minister has done is bringing unity among the farmers. Earlier, there were various strands and now all of us are one unit. We are certain that we will win through this agitation.”Holding placards and raising slogans demanding the repeal of the three laws, a group of 25 women from Punjab’s Patran town said they had reached the Delhi border three days ago for the rally.Rajinder Kaur, one of the women present there said, “It looks like the Prime Minister cannot see us or hear us despite us being in such large numbers. He has forgotten that we are the ones who have voted him to power. Through the tractor rally we would like to tell the government that it better take the laws back.”Seated atop a tractor, Gurwinder Singh, a farmer from Patiala said: “This tractor rally was just the prelude to the main parade. Through today’s [Thursday] rally we were successful in displaying our preparations and strength to the government and give them an idea of how the rally on Republic Day will look like. We are an extremely peaceful lot and we have no intention of getting into face-offs with any person or authority of any kind.”Taranjeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Nawanshahr district said, “Through this parade we have given an idea about what the government can expect for the rally on Republic Day. The rally that day will be similar and in fact, on a much larger scale as we are going to call for more tractors to join us at the border.”\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:00:51 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rows-of-tractors-take-over-highways/article33523692.ece\\n',\n",

Later in the evening, they took me in preventive custody and produced before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate court,” said Mr. Chaudhary. Another social activist and farmer leader, Umar Padla, claimed that a police team reached his house in the morning and stayed there till around noon preventing him from going outside.“The police had been calling me for the past few days seeking details of the proposed tractor rally,” he claimed. Two more farmer leaders, Azad Kheri and Rashid Advocate, were taken to the local police stations and let off in the evening, said Mr. Padla. Salamudeen Meo, president, Mewat Vikas Sabha alleged that the police had put barricades at several intersections, including Badkali Chowk, and did not allow the farmers to come out on the Gurugram-Alwar Highway (NH-248A) to reach the KMP. “Around a dozen tractors from each of the six blocks were scheduled to be part of the march, but the police did not allow it. Eventually, around 30 people in half-a-dozen cars reached Palwal from Nuh to express solidarity with the farmers,” said Mr. Meo.Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav also tweeted around noon about the detention of Mr. Chaudhary and warned the government against any ill-treatment against him.Narendra Bijarniya, SP, Nuh, said that only Mr. Chaudhary was detained. “Umar was at his house all day because of some tragedy in the village and Azad came to the police station on his own and then went back a few hours later. Rashid came with a few tractors from Punhana, but he did not have the plan [of the march] and was sent back,” said Mr. Bijarniya.Meanwhile, another batch of tractors scheduled to march on KMP from Dhasa border to Manesar also altered its plan in the morning to go towards Tikri border.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:00:54 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/four-farmer-leaders-involved-with-tractor-rally-preparations-detained/article33523684.ece\\n',\n",

Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, “During the 2017 municipal election campaign, then Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari promised that there will be no scarcity of money in the corporations because the BJP will directly bring money or fund from the Central government. Manoj Tiwari misled the people of Delhi by making false promises and did not bring a single penny from the Centre, he should resign from the post of MP.” He said that despite getting funds from the Delhi government, increasing house tax and other taxes, the BJP-ruled municipal corporations claim that they do not have any money to pay the salaries of the employees. Attacking the AAP, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said, “[Arvind] Kejriwal is not releasing ₹13,000 crore to the civic bodies as recommended by the Delhi Finance Commission. By not releasing ₹13,000 crore, he is forcing municipal employees to die of starvation.”Mr. Bharadwaj said that employees of the BJP-ruled corporations are protesting at the Civic Centre, demanding the immediate release of their pending salaries. “Doctors, nurses, medical officials, teachers, sanitation workers and others who have worked relentlessly in the time of COVID-19 pandemic have not received their salaries.”Earlier in the day, the AAP held “mohalla sabhas” to expose BJP’s alleged corruption in the municipal corporations. On Monday, the AAP had said that they would hold 2,500 mohalla-level meetings to tell people about an alleged ₹2,500 crore corruption by the BJP-ruled municipal corporations from January 7 to 15. Addressing the first Mohalla Sabha at Kalkaji Assembly, AAP MLA Atishi said, “There has been a ₹2,500-crore scam in the BJP-ruled municipalities. This scam is the biggest-ever scam in Delhi’s history. This money was to be paid to doctors, nurses, sanitation workers and teachers. But the BJP leaders have looted this money, due to which the employees of all these departments could not be paid.”\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:00:56 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-has-failed-should-hold-fresh-civic-elections-says-aap/article33523652.ece\\n',\n",

About 90% of the power generated in the Manuguru solar plant would be utilised for local needs including 65% by the company’s residential quarters and offices and another 25% for running the machinery in mines in Manuguru area and the remaining 10% for mining activity and residential quarters in Illendu area.Singareni is utilising 4 million units of energy for the mining activity in Manuguru area and another 1 million units for domestic needs from the Northern Discom. However, after the commissioning of Manuguru area solar plant, about 3.3 MU for mining activity and about 0.9 MU for domestic needs is being drawn from the plant, saving about ₹1.2 crore on energy bills per month.Once the establishment of 300 MW capacity solar plants is completed by SCCL, the company could save about ₹100-120 crore per annum on power bills.

He said Mr. Rama Rao deliberately ignored the project sanctioned by the previous UPA government to Hyderabad and has never put pressure on the BJP government at the Centre.

Such an important project was not taken up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Chief Minister K.

Mr. Sampath reminded that the project was sanctioned in 2008 when Mr. Kiran Kumar Reddy was the Chief Minister and Mr. Ponnala Lakshmaiah was the Minister for IT and necessary permissions were also given to spread IT industry around the districts connected to the city. It was also included in the AP Reorganisation Act to ensure the project is taken up to benefit lakhs of unemployed in Telangana. However, the TRS government has totally neglected in in the last six years and has now suddenly woke up writing letters to the Central government.

For, the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Hyderabad has embarked on an ambitious project of crowdsourcing at least 2,000 hours of speech in this language that could be used in such devices.According to Prakash Yalla from IIIT’s Technology Transfer Office, the move comes after talks between various organisations and the Centre. Around ₹1 crore has been earmarked for the project. The initiative seeks to give a large number of speakers of regional languages, such as Telugu, access to gadgets that use Artificial Intelligence enabled speech recognition such as Siri or Alexa.The intention is to crowdsource speech from different regions of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in order to include the diversity of language, spread across the region. For instance, there are differences in the Telugu spoken in Telangana, Rayalaseema and Andhra regions. Also, the way in which a youth speaks is different from the speech of senior citizens. The challenge is the quality of the dataset. For this, the IIIT team is working on devising certain data collection protocols.“Good quality data is collected when we are speaking naturally, with emotions and in an environment which is natural to us, in conversational language. This would be different when we, say, talk on the stage or studio which is a controlled environment,” Mr Yalla says.To capture data, the IIIT team comprising Mr. Yalla and Prof. Anil Vuppala from the Speech Processing Centre decided to go for a voice telephony platform, and teamed up with Ozonetel. A link is given to the volunteer with a topic in Telugu (Games or television, which is better?). The user has to enter his or her mobile phone number, after which a screen seeks information of the age group of the volunteer: Junior (0-18), Young (18-30), Adult (31-59) and senior (60 above). It also seeks information on the volunteer’s native accent, and gender. After this the volunteer can speak into the microphone on the device and the speech will be recorded.“The platform captures the data in a 16khz, 16 bit format, so that the entire voice spectrum is captured. To ensure data protection, the speech goes into different channels after which it is broken using an algorithm. These are anonymised and mixed into a master dataset. This fragment is then given to transcribers,” Mr. Yalla says.The IIIT team is planning to have the 2,000 hour dataset ready in about a year, without compromising on quality. If required, the quantum of data could be increased to 5,000 hours.“A lot of transcribers and speech contributors have come forward, including those from colleges. This will cover the youth spectrum. We are launching campaigns to see that systems are robust and adults are also covered, in rural areas as well,” Mr. Yalla says.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:18 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/iiit-h-starts-project-to-crowdsource-hours-of-speech-in-telugu/article33523747.ece\\n',\n",

COVID biological waste burnt, mixed with trash in Hyderabad\\n\\nLocalised waste disposal in sharp contrast to strict norms laid by CPCB\\n\\nLocalised waste disposal in sharp contrast to strict norms laid by CPCB\\nMedical as well as sanitary workers in Hyderabad are being put in harm’s way as COVID biological waste is being burnt, tossed in garbage and mixed with regular trash.“We burn the PPE kits everyday. They are used by the staff who do COVID-19 tests. We collect them, pack them in a box and burn them,” said a health worker at the Golconda Area Hospital. Four cardboard boxes filled with PPEs were still burning when this reporter visited the site. Behind the COVID-19 testing centre in the hospital, the biological waste of test kits and discarded gloves are also burnt on a daily basis.Elsewhere in the city, in some of the Primary Health Centres, the CBW is thrown with regular trash into garbage bins. “We don’t know when they will come to collect it, so we drop it at this garbage bin as we have to carry on our work everyday,” said a healthcare worker at a PHC in Malakpet area who has to cross the road with the yellow bags to reach the overfilled garbage bin. Hyderabad has 97 government facilities where on an average 60 to 200 tests are performed everyday. This number doesn’t include centres in private domain or where RT-PCR tests are conducted. The Central Pollution Control Board guidelines for waste from test centres and labs are the same as that of isolation wards and they should be collected in red bags. This localised waste disposal is in sharp contrast to the strict norms laid out by CPCB, which is followed by Ramky Enviro (REEL) tasked with disposing of the CBW in Hyderabad. “COVID biological waste gets priority over everything else. We dispose of it immediately in static or rotary incinerators at temperatures ranging from 850 degree to 1,050 degree Celsius. The flu gas is also monitored on a continual basis,” said Masood Mallick of Ramky Enviro. Asked about slippages in collection, he said, “We have a specialised staff who have volunteered and have been incentivised for the task. From the point of pick up to transport, treatment and disposal, everything is tracked on a continuous basis.”The PCB has rolled out an Android App called COVID19BWM which helps track the movement of the waste from labs, quarantine centres and hospitals. Telangana processed 68.82 tonnes of COVID biological waste (CBW) in December, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Comparatively, Chandigarh, which has a population of 11 lakh, treated 73.19 tonnes of CBW. From a peak of 188.82 tonnes in September, this sharp dip in the quantity of biological waste shows either how the impact of the pandemic is on the wane or the slippages in CBW have increased. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:20 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/toxic-covid-biological-waste-burnt-mixed-with-trash/article33523675.ece\\n',\n",

Claimed to be the first such in Telangana, the project of Solika Energy will supply compressed biogas, in cylinders, to an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) outlet in Attapur. Commercial sale at the outlet is expected to begin next month.The CBG plant was formally opened in the last week of December by Executive Director and State Head of IOC for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh RSS Rao along with International Egg Commission Chairman and Srinivasa Farms Group Managing Director Suresh Chitturi, a release on Thursday said. The CBG project exclusively uses poultry litter as raw material and is located next to a large commercial poultry farm with over 4.5 lakh birds. All the raw material from the poultry sheds will be collected to generate biogas. In addition to CBG, the plant will also generate around 15 tonnes of organic manure as a by product daily. Solika Energy has developed the project under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme of the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. A company backed by Srinivasa Hatcheries and XEMX Projects, Solika Energy is in the process of setting up a second CBG project in Telangana. It will come up in Kandukur, a village on the way to Srisailam from Hyderabad, and have a CBG production capacity of 3 tonnes per day. Mr. Chitturi said that Solika has developed a unique process of ammonia reduction which results in sustained reuse of water making the biogas plant zero liquid discharge. The process removes and reduces all impurities like feathers, stones, and sand. Solika plans to provide the organic manure to the local farming communities, he said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:22 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/compressed-biogas-project-based-on-poultry-litter-set-up/article33523631.ece\\n',\n",

Mr. Chacko, who was arrested under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, was released on station bail, while others were slapped with non-bailable charges. The police have so far arrested eight V4 Kochi activists since Tuesday in connection with the unauthorised opening of the Vyttila flyover, which is slated to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister on Saturday. Four, including the organisation campaign controller Nipun Cherian, were arrested late on Tuesday night. “More arrests are likely in the days to come, since we are not only after those who had illegally opened up the flyover but also those who had participated in a protest at Vyttila before, demanding the immediate opening of the flyover,” said a police official associated with the probe.

The project to build a multi-rise building in the place of the existing station building is still in its preliminary stage. Private firms or a consortium of firms can participate in the bidding. The Thiruvananthapuram Division of the Southern Railway has already handed over the land where the present station is located to the RLDA. Now, it is up to the agency to take a call on tenders and execute the project, said a senior railway official. Private stakeholder(s) will have to ready a design which makes optimal use of available space, pool in funds and construct the building. The land will be leased to them for a particular period, and they will be able to make commercial use of whatever space the Railway does not need. But the Railway will operate the entire premises, since it owns the land, he added. The project’s concept says the station ought to be developed to international standards, as a multi-modal transport hub. The amenities must be disabled friendly too, having acess ramps, lifts, and tactile flooring. There must also be seamless flow of passengers in all weather conditions. The structures must also be eco-friendly and must make maximum use of light and ventilation. The RLDA, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, had earlier entrusted KITCO with the task of readying a report on amenities for passengers, eateries, multi-tier parking space for private and public transport vehicles, and a skywalk to the adjacent Kochi metro station (where too commercial space is available), apart from commercial ventures for which space could be earmarked in the building. The last date to submit RFQ is February 22. . The Thiruvananthapuram Railway Division will involve with the project after the tender is awarded. On its part, the Railway is keen to extend three short platforms by a few hundred metres, so that they can hold trains having 24 coaches. The inadequate availability of lengthy platforms is one reason why express trains are held up outside the station, official sources said. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:31 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/redevelopment-of-ekm-jn-station-gets-a-boost/article33524517.ece\\n',\n",

The chamber in its pre-budget memorandum submitted to Finance Minister Thomas Isaac contended that while other major towns grew in area, Kochi has more or less stood still since its formation. The Kochi Corporation covers an area of only 94.88 sq. km. But the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, which had an area of only 30.66 sq. km. during its formation has grown to 214.86 sq. km. This will give a focused approach for development, Cochin Chamber president K. Harikumar said. The chamber proposed reduction of VAT from 14.5% to enhance the utilisation of natural gas in Kerala itself from the recently inaugurated Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline. Tamil Nadu charges only 4%, and it will give an impetus for development and growth, he said.The chamber also sought the formation of a maritime cluster based on Willingdon Island at par with leading international maritime centres, to be included in the budget. This was proposed by State government in Ascend 2020. The project will develop core, financial, regulatory and other services (tourism, maritime museum etc.). The chamber also sought finalisation of maritime rules to facilitate the implementation of the Maritime Board Act 2017. It commended the government for taking proactive steps for the formulation of a plantation policy. Kerala produces around 48% of the total plantation crops in the country. Around 3.3 lakh labourers are directly dependent on plantations. On ease of doing business, the chamber sought to make Kerala Industry 4.0 ready. Industry 4.0 is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, and Cloud Computing. Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a ‘Smart Factory’.The chamber also demanded governance reforms, representation of more industry organisations in committees of the government, and a comprehensive and unified Kerala Public Health Act.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:33 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cochin-chamber-seeks-expansion-of-corporation-limits/article33524491.ece\\n',\n",

One among them is the point south of the junction in front of Mylalath Temple, where vehicles tend to divert from the NH Bypass and take the service road, to avoid long queue awaiting the green signal. They create traffic hold-ups when they try to re-enter the bypass when vehicles begin moving on getting the green signal. This will not be permitted. In addition, more time might be allotted to vehicles coming from Palarivattom to Edappally Junction, to cross the junction,” said Francis Shelby, Assistant Commissioner of Police, City Traffic Police (East). The other two bottlenecked locations are located at the gate of Lulu Mall that faces the Edappally-Varapuzha national highway and the junction north of that. Parking curbs for around 600 metres from the junction and other regulations like redirecting vehicles which want to take U-turn to the underpass of the Edapally overbridge too are on the cards, he said. The police foresee approximately 20% increase in the number of vehicles converging at Palarivattom and Edappally from Vyttila, once the flyovers on the NH Bypass are commissioned on Saturday. Among those who cited the possibility of traffic hold-ups worsening at Edappally include Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Babu John. “The additional influx of vehicles is likely to cause snarls at the junction. Commuters must be encouraged to avail public transport to lessen snarls at such junctions,” he said. While expressing concern that serpentine snarls may develop at Edappally, especially when discount sales are announced at Lulu Mall, a senior PWD official said the State government or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) must take a call on the underpass linking the NH Bypass and the Edappally-Varapuzha NH corridor, which Metroman E. Sreedharan and many others suggested long ago, to decongest the junction. “The junction urgently needs a four-lane underpass, which will lessen congestion by over half,” said P.R. Padmanabhan Nair, president, Edappally Vikasana Samiti. The existing flyover would have served its purpose if it landed beyond the Edappally Toll Junction, he added.Social activist K.A. Francis said an underpass and realisation of the long-awaited Ponekkara bridge would ensure streamlined flow of vehicles at the junction. The bridge will open up an alternative corridor for vehicles to North Paravur. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:01:38 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-ready-plan-to-meet-spike-in-snarls-at-edappally/article33524434.ece\\n',\n",

The hospital, saddled with a major share of COVID-19 patients for the last 11 months, has its 40 ICU beds fully occupied, and unless an alternative arrangement is made, opening of IP could be troublesome, said Dr. V. Satheesh, Principal, MCH . The 73 house surgeons had a turbulent year, rues Siby Manuel Jose, a house surgeon. “While we performed duty at the COVID triage for the first four-and-a-half months, for clinical postings, students were divided into three batches and allocated to Kottayam, Alappuzha and Ernakulam Medical Colleges on rotation. That got over by December 31. And, it was agreed that OP and IP would be opened since January beginning. But while the outpatient wing began to function in a limited manner, IP was shut a day after it was opened,” he said.While the students feel that the burn ICU and the cath facility could be used tentatively as non-COVID ICU. They also argued that it was possible to shift low-category COVID-19 patients to an adjacent block for admission of non-COVID patients in wards. “It is possible to ensure there is segregation of patients in the two categories,” said Mr. Jose. But the principal said it may not be possible. “However, we held a meeting with the District Collector on Monday and requested him to make alternative ICU arrangements. That is being done at the district hospital in Aluva. But it takes a fortnight to a month’s time. In the meantime, we have a schedule to restore all non-COVID operations in a phased manner,” he added. While the hospital has reopened medical, surgery and orthopaedic OPs, primarily to give clinical exposure to the house surgeons, its continuing pivotal role in the COVID-19 fight in the district is throwing the spanner in its academic role, said senior doctors. “We have to apportion a chunk of our staff to the COVID facility.

The new production, the second play of Aadyam’s Digital Edition, which has been directed by film and theatre veteran Akash Khurana, features actors Vivek Madan, Arghya Lahiri, and Nadir Khan. The pre-recorded production will be streamed online on January 9, 16 and 17. Talking about the play, Akash says, “It retains everything about the original [novel] without being a bad parody or a ridiculous spoof. It actually enhances the spirit of the novel. That’s what I found wonderful because you have to be totally in love with the text to be able to keep the magic and yet do your own take on it. The fact that we’ve been asked to revisit it and do online [shows]… Obviously, the taste of the pudding has worked. It’s been tested and the audience has loved it.”Do people have a fixed idea of how they want to see Sherlock Holmes every time the stories are adapted for stage or screen? “Some people may have a fixed idea but the problem is that the new generation doesn’t read,” says Akash. “They may have seen the show [Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch] which, in any case, is not the original [it is a modern-day adaptation]. The fact that they liked it means the character works. I do believe that some of the people who watched the play went back and read the original stories. So, in a larger context, it helps to introduce people to something that is special.”The experience of doing theatre with no live audience present owing to the pandemic was unusual, but Akash found that it also led to people pushing their creativity and trying out variations of art forms. “What our company discovered is that it’s tough to restrain people who want to be creative and be out there. My company, AKvarious Productions, actually had performances online through the six-seven months. So, it’s not dampened people’s spirits; it’s hampered activity to some extent. But definitely, the way things are done has changed. While things are opening up now, March to November were desperate times. The silver lining was that come what may, things survive if not thrive.”The three actors — Vivek, Arghya, and Nadir — take on 15 roles — a particular challenge for the director working with the actors mostly online. “The text kind of provides for those variations in terms of basic guidelines. Then the rapport that I have with the actors is so comfortable; they are so bright on the take,” he says.The actors went on the floor for only about a week whereas the original production required about three to six months of rehearsal. “For this, we did about 15 online sessions. Ultimately, we shot it over two days,” says Akash. “We added several kinds of cameras; we could pick and choose angles and make it more of a ‘tactile’ experience. For me, that’s the victory. That we got this almost, if not better than the original, with one-tenth of the rehearsals.”The shows begin at 7 pm.

It is too premature to divulge details about deliberations at the meeting, he added.KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the target of the Congress was to achieve cent percent success in the Assembly elections. The party will study the reasons for its failures, he said.He alleged that the CPI(M) and the BJP had joined hands against the Congress in the State. “Plans are afoot to accommodate youngsters in the electoral fray. The selection of candidates will be foolproof and transparent,” Mr. Ramachandran.On the Congress having covert and overt relationships with the Welfare Party of India, the political arm of the Jamaat Islami Hind, Mr. Ramachandran said it was a closed chapter. He declined to comment on rumours of his candidature in the Assembly polls.Earlier, K. Sudhakaran, MP, said the high command was vested with powers to effect any changes in the State leadership of the party. The Congress will not have any tacit understanding with the Welfare Party of India.

The case was adjourned by two weeks.The contempt petition was filed by S. Pandi from Theni district who had also filed the original public interest litigation petition in 2017. He had sought a direction to the authorities concerned to restore the wildlife habitat in Megamalai Wildlife Sanctuary and to remove encroachments.In 2018, the court had directed the authorities concerned to take appropriate action to remove all encroachments by following due process and the entire exercise had to be completed in eight weeks. However, the authorities failed to remove the encroachments, he complained. He said contempt proceedings must be initiated against the officials for failing to comply with the order of the court. During the course of the hearing, the State informed the court that the encroachers were identified and notices served on them.

There were five murders and four suicides, said A. Kathir, executive director of Evidence, Madurai-based non-governmental organisation.Speaking to reporters here on Friday, he said the government had done nothing tangible to discourage these offences and stood as a mute spectator, in contravention of broad guidelines laid out by the Supreme Court in March 2018.A fact-finding team from the Evidence visited a vilalge in Karur district where a 23-year-old youth, Hariharan, was brutally murdered by a 12-member gang in broad daylight on January 6.The boy from a barber community and the girl from an intermediate caste were in love for three years. The family members of the girl had summoned the boy and his father and threatened with dire consequences. The girl had subsequently called Hariharan’s mother and informed that she would marry only her son.While the police had arrested only five accused till Thursday, the remaining suspects figuring in the complaint must also be arrested, Mr. Kathir said.The State government should give ₹25 lakh as compensation to Hariharan’s family, the police should be directed to oppose the bail applications and the government should strengthen security for inter-caste or inter community couples who lived in constant threat.The Centre should frame stringent laws against the offenders and implement them across the country, which alone would prevent the rise in honour killings, Mr. Kathir said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:02:04 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/honour-killings-are-on-the-rise-in-state-ngo/article33531924.ece\\n',\n",

Moorthy\\n With less than a week left for Pongal festival, bull owners and tamers have intensified their practice to ensure that they are well prepared for the slew of jallikattu events this season. M. Stalin, a bull rearer from Madakulam, says that his bull - ‘karuppu’ - is given a swimming practice at least twice a week in the run-up to the jallikattu events. “Swimming is an important workout for the bull as it aids better agility during jallikattu,” he says. As part of the practice routine, the bulls are also made to ‘gore’ a mound of earth with their horns, he adds.A nutrituous diet for the bulls are followed for two months prior to the jallikattu events, says S. Subash, a bull owner from Vadipatti. “Bulls are given cotton seeds, wheat husk mixed with water and date palms. Many rearers also feed their bulls a mixture of various millets,” he says. While the bull rearers are happy that jallikattu events are conducted this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the restriction of allowing only two caretakers for each bull during the jallikattu event poses a problem, says the president of Tamil Nadu Jallikattu Peravai, P. Rajasekar. “At least four persons are required to take care of one bull. The caretakers reach the venue the previous night of the jallikattu event. It will be extremely difficult for two persons to release the bulls through the ‘vadivasal’ (the place through which bulls are let into the arena) and to get hold of the bulls at the collection points,” he says. Mr. Subash says the jallikattu organising committee members must assess the number of bulls that were released into the arena in the previous years and accordingly issue tokens this year.  The bull tamers have also stepped up their practice for jallikattu events. Members of ‘Jallikattu Training Centre,’ a centre which trains tamers, have been practising by setting up mock ‘vadivasal.’ President of the Centre B. Manikandaprabu says experienced players share techniques and their expertise with young bull tamers. “If a player knows how to approach a running bull in the arena, it will reduce the possibilities of accidents,” he says. The players have intensified their workout routine in the past three months, says P. Ranjith, a bull tamer. “For the past several years, the bull tamers have been urging the officials to ensure that proper facilities are available for players during the jallikattu event. The officials must focus on providing better amenities for bull tamers this year,” he says. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:02:12 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bull-owners-and-tamers-intensify-practice-ahead-of-jallikattu/article33531664.ece\\n',\n",

Regional languages have been omitted in the recruitment notification, though it was announced on July 16, 2019 on the floor of Parliament that those examinations for the recruitment in Department of Posts would be conducted in regional languages also, he pointed out.“This announcement was made following stiff opposition from MPs against the earlier decision of conducting tests only in English and Hindi for the recruitment of postmen.

The same stance was confirmed by the Union government before the Madras High Court also when the case came for hearing on July 30, 2019. But, the Department of Posts has now issued a notification for the examination scheduled on February 14 and the choices of the medium is confined only to Hindi and English.

He introduced the VVPO Vivekanandam (a police constable, who would be responsible for the hamlet) at the meeting.In a brief interaction, Mr Murugan said that the initiative would be useful to senior citizens as they would not have to travel long to reach the police stations for any issues regarding their hamlets. The VVPO would have a WhatsApp group in which he may add teachers, village panchayat members and among others.From the police perspective, he said that the VVPO’s presence would help prevent crime, which may otherwise snowball into a major incident. Incidents of eve-teasing complaints or a drunken brawl can all be handled locally if the local people share information with the VVPO.Welcoming the VVPO, the villagers offered shawls and garlanded him in the presence of the senior officers. In Koduvilaarpatti, the women thanked the police for establishing the concept, since the police station was a little far away. Moreover, the presence of a man in khaki may discourage the offenders from indulging in crimes, they added.Superintendent of Police Sai Charan Tejaswi said that the VVPO was a kind of mini-police station for the villagers. Apart from sharing information with the VVPO, the residents can also be in touch with the officers at the station or sub-division levels. The idea was to share an issue early and solve it amicably as soon as possible.There were 146 mother villages identified in the district, which would have a VVPO from the nearest station.

Stalin during the gram sabha meeting held recently at Thondamuthur in Coimbatore Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a bullock cart race at Muthiahapuram on Friday, Mr. Raju said the Tamil Nadu Government, to ensure impartial and transparent probe and to unravel the entire truth behind the Pollachi sexual assault case had handed over the investigation to CBI. When the AIADMK functionaries were arrested in connection with this case, the party high command immediately removed them from the primary membership of the party and hence there was no question of anyone helping the accused, as was being alleged by Ms. Kanimozhi, he said. “We are for a fair probe and are keen on punishing the real culprits. If the MP (Ms. Kanimozhi) is really concerned about women and their safety, she should have raised her voice when a woman was assaulted by the DMK men for having raised a question at the gram sabha meeting chaired by party president Mr. Stalin recently. After verbally abusing her, the DMK men evicted her from the meeting and misbehaved with her. Ms. Kanimozhi should have condemned this act of her party functionaries. But she did not do so and it only shows her partiality when it comes to women’s rights and their safety,” Mr. Raju charged. On the Union Ministry of Home Affairs directive that the Tamil Nadu Government should revoke its order of allowing 100% occupancy in cinema halls, the Minister said the State Government had relaxed the lockdown norms for the public visiting malls, parks and other public places in the wake of sharp fall in the number of fresh COVID-19 cases. In this line, cent per cent occupancy in the cinema theatres was also allowed following request from the actors, producers, cinema theatre owners in the wake of Pongal celebrations. “Against this backdrop, we’ve received the Union Government’s directive which is neither a ban nor a warning. The Chief Minister, after discussing it with the officials concerned will take an appropriate decision,” Mr. Raju said. Later in the evening, he told the reporters at Kovilpatti that Udhayanidhi, DMK youth wing president and son of Mr. Stalin, had crossed all the limits for saying that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was hand-picked by late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s confidante V. K. Sasikala, for the post. “M.

Moreover, the dry run was conducted with the objective of preparing the medical team involved in the exercise for possible adverse reactions to the vaccine in the worst case scenario after vaccination. In Tirunelveli city, the dry run was conducted at two places – Urban Primary Health Centres at Mela Veeraraghavapuram and Peace Health Centre, a private hospital on the South Bypass Road near the Vaeinthaankulam new bus-stand, and three places in rural Tirunelveli – Primary Health Centres at Kallidaikurichi, Munanjipatti and the Government Hospital at Koodankulam. After the body temperature of the beneficiary was recorded and their Aadhaar card details were uploaded in the CoWIN App, they received the vaccine during the dry run. The vaccinated individuals were asked to leave the centre after being monitored for about 30 minutes. Moreover, internet connectivity at the vaccination centres was also checked. As per the plan, 25 persons for every two hours with the maximum of 100 persons per centre per day will be vaccinated. “The medical teams being involved in the vaccination have been prepared well ahead of the start of actual vaccination. After the data about the medical teams were uploaded in the CoWIN App developed for this purpose, the beneficiary would receive on their mobile phone information regarding the place and time where the vaccination would be done. Upon vaccination, the beneficiary would receive the e-certificate through the App,” said the public health department officials involved in it. In the first phase, the frontline health workers fighting against the dreaded viral infection since March last would be vaccinated and other officials involved in the work – personnel from police and revenue departments – would receive the dose in the second phase. In the third phase, senior citizens above the age of 60 and those who are suffering from ailments for long would get it. The public would receive the vaccine in the fourth and the final phase and hence the dry run is much essential to ensure hassle-free vaccination.

              " \"\\nKCCI opposes MESCOM's proposal for power tariff hike \\n‘If hike was allowed, it amounts to rewarding inefficiency’\\n\\n‘If hike was allowed, it amounts to rewarding inefficiency’\\n The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has opposed Mangalore Electricity Supply Company’s (MESCOM) proposal to increase power tariff by ₹1 at a time, when BESCOM did not propose any increase and also proposed reduction in tariff for high-tension industrial consumers.In a memorandum to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who holds the Energy portfolio, chamber president Isaac Vas said MESCOM’s proposal for tariff hike would severely affect power consumers in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Shivamogga, and Chikkamagaluru.At a time when micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) were contributing to over 29% of GDP across the country and employing crores of people, power tariff hike would affect their very existence. In Dakshina Kannada alone, over 1 lakh people were employed in MSME as against a mere 10,000 by mega industries, he pointed out.With COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown impacting their cash cycles, MSMEs that were the backbone of India’s inclusive growth story have received a severe jolt and faced multiple bottlenecks and retardation. The country-wide lockdown dragged MSME owners, employees and external stakeholders to unexpected repulsions. Extended lockdown hurt the supply of finished goods, procurement of raw material, and employees’ availability to work in production and supply processes. Post lockdown, MSMEs face challenges related to debt repayments, wages/salaries, statutory dues, etc.Mr. Vas said the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission that approves tariff hikes comprises mainly retired government servants and ESCOM executives. Thus, there was always ‘conflict of interest’ while considering power tariff hike. Industry and professional bodies should have adequate representation in KERC so that the commission could advise ESCOMs to follow the best practices in distribution and efficiency in power management.It is not just MSMEs that get affected if tariff was hiked, but the common man would also considerably be affected. With many losing their jobs or getting salary cuts, people would find it difficult to bear the increased bill.If hike was allowed, it would be nothing but rewarding the inefficiency of ESCOMs in reducing their overheads and distribution losses, Mr. Vas said, adding MSMEs would collapse if hike was allowed.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:02:32 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/kcci-opposes-mescoms-proposal-for-power-tariff-hike/article33530617.ece\\n\",\n",

MANJUNATH\\n  Blaming the Bharatiya Janata Party-controlled Mangaluru City Corporation council for the poor state of solid waste management in the city, J.R. Lobo, former Mangaluru City South MLA, on Friday said the solid waste management has reached a new low and is bringing a bad name to the city.Mr. Lobo said personnel from Antony Waste Handling Cell Private Limited were not collecting waste from houses daily in several areas and the waste is getting dumped by the roadside. Dumping was also happening on Fridays when the personnel collect only dry waste. He said MCC was not properly paying the private firm the charges for the door-to-door collection and this was leading to protests by the personnel. No action has been taken by the MCC to collect solid waste management cess from people, he said.“There were problems in solid waste management when our party ruled the MCC. But we ensured day-to-day collection of waste and timely payment of charges to the firm. We never allowed disruption of collection of waste,” Mr. Lobo claimed.More than a year since the damage caused due to garbage slip at the landfill site in Pachhanady, the State Government is yet to properly compensate the residents and address their needs. “The BJP came to power by showing that the Congress failed to properly govern the city. You have failed the people. The solid waste management is in a very bad shape now,” he said. The BJP has to give a serious thought on the issue and take steps to improve it in the second phase of the Swachh Bharat Mission, which is presently on, he said.Senior councillor Shashidhar Hegde and Leader of Opposition in MCC Council Abdul Ravoof also spoke. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:02:37 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mcc-continues-to-be-poor-in-solid-waste-management-lobo/article33530415.ece\\n',\n",

Patil here on Thursday.Speaking to reporters after meeting MLAs and members of the District Task Force from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, Mr. Patil said that with areas in the coastal districts divided into Coastal Regulatory Zone and non-CRZ, the sand extraction policy has to be different from the one that applies to other parts of the State.“Such a policy is a long-pending demand. The State government is committed to resolving it,” Mr. Patil said and added that a high-level meeting will be held in Bengaluru shortly. The Deputy Commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi will be invited to it. “We will make an announcement in another 15 days,” he said.Affirming the commitment of the government to providing sand at affordable prices, the Minister said that if more licences are issued for extraction, the rate of sand will automatically come down. “Sand is now available at ₹ 6,000 per load in Dakshina Kannada. It will come down further,” the Minister said.Mr. Patil said that Mysuru Minerals Limited has been asked to extract sand in 30 blocks in the non-CRZ areas where more than 10,000 tonnes of sand are available in each block in Dakshina Kannada. In areas where fewer quantity is available, agencies such as Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited will be asked to extract sand. As many as 104 people have been involved in traditional extraction of sand in CRZ areas since 2011. This number will be slightly increased, he said. The State government will come down hard on those involved in illegal transportation of sand and illegal extraction of red stone. Surveillance cameras are being placed at 196 places in Dakshina Kannada to keep a tab on inter-State movement of vehicles, he said.While there are about 800 sites identified for extraction of laterite stones, only one permit has been issued. The government would enhance the numbers after scrutinising applications by 250 persons in a fortnight to allow such extraction only in patta lands, Mr. Patil said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:02:39 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/sand-policy-exclusively-for-coastal-districts-in-15-days/article33523930.ece\\n',\n",

Sunil Kumar said that elected public representatives of the region were demanding the sand policy for the last two years. “The pressing problem needs to be addressed and the issue needs to be taken to a logical conclusion,” Mr. Kumar said.Mr. Kumar said that as in CRZ areas, where sand is allowed to be extracted in a traditional way, provision should be made to allow traditional extraction of sand by going down to the riverbed in non-CRZ areas too. “Traditional sand extraction was allowed prior to 2011. Not allowing traditional extraction of sand in non-CRZ areas now is leading to law and order problem,” he said. When Additional Chief Secretary (Mines) G. Kumara Naik and Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra pointed out that panchayats were empowered to take steps for extraction of sand from the riverbeds and vented dams in their jurisdiction, Mr. Kumar said that panchayats lacked expertise in getting sand extracted. Mr. Kateel said that the government should allow traditional sand extraction by local residents in places such as Belthangady where the river flows continuously. In places such as Puttur and Sullia, where there is no need for traditional sand extraction, panchayats should be allowed to extract sand using the services of government and other agencies.

Swiggy and Flipkart’s delivery service arm Instakart are under the scanner for involvement in a fake GST invoice fraud, a Revenue Department official, who did not wish to be identified, said on Friday. Apart from action under the GST laws, the Income Tax department has also joined the investigation as the fake GST claims amount to concealment of income.  “As a law-abiding company, we are in full compliance with the tax and legal mandates,” said a spokesperson for Swiggy. “Our team extended full cooperation to the concerned authorities,” the spokesperson added. Two senior Instakart officials have not yet responded to summons from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and have moved the courts for anticipatory bail in a case involving incorrect availment as well as passing on, of input tax credits worth ₹21 crore, the official said. Their bail hearing is listed at the Patiala House District & Sessions court on January 13, the official added. While sources at Swiggy asserted that the tax authorities had initiated a follow-up survey at the firm due to a third-party vendor’s alleged default, the revenue department contends that the modus operandi of the fraud, which has been carried out since 2017, suggests the involvement of the company’s management. “The arrested mastermind Gagan Gupta alias Gagan Kumar, has admitted to have committed the ITC scams in connivance with Instakart and Swiggy through various fake firms of manpower supplies to both business entities and where cash used to exchange hands later,” the official said. “How could the manpower supply take place between a supplier and a service user company without direct and explicit involvement of these companies’ management,” the official wondered. In the case of Instakart, the tax department said the input tax credits were wrongfully claimed and utilised, based on fake invoices of non-existent firms named STMPL and MFPL for manpower supplies which never actually took place. “When two officials of Instakart were shown documents pertaining to non-existence of STMPL and MFPL and bank accounts of these two non-existing companies showing debit entries form Instakart as salary, they could not explain it and started trying to locate these two vendors,” the revenue department official said. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:46:49 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/swiggy-instakart-under-gst-scanner/article33532216.ece\\n',\n",

              " '\\nGetting ready for vaccination \\nTraining more and more healthcare workers to become COVID-19 experts is the way forward\\n\\nTraining more and more healthcare workers to become COVID-19 experts is the way forward\\nLearning from one anotherMore trainingWith the announcement that India has approved two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, we may finally be seeing some light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. That’s good news.But India is also at a fork in the road: are we prepared to dramatically increase the number of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who are trained for immunising and treating us? If not, none of these advances will matter for millions of our citizens.This is a problem that can be solved. If we do it right, we will not only be able to provide care for 1.6 billion people, but also have a model to show to the world on how vaccination and treatment can be done quickly and skillfully. If the world’s second-most populated nation can vaccinate and treat its people, other countries with far fewer daunting challenges can learn from India and save millions of lives.The Hindu Explains | Why was a COVID-19 vaccine dry run necessary, and how was it organised?Over 4,00,000 frontline workers in India have been trained to respond to COVID-19. This number represents a massive ramping up of skills for many professionals who had never had this training. Thousands have learned about contact tracing, quarantine strategies, ventilator management, personal protective equipment, and psychological issues.India was a beneficiary of a successful global innovation called Project ECHO. It’s a low-cost solution for increasing the capacity of health workers in underserved communities to provide patients with the best possible care. Using videoconferencing technology, community health workers, nurses and doctors — generalists by training — learn specialty care from subject matter experts and from each others’ community informed knowledge. ECHO started as a strategy for treating Hepatitis C, and is now responsible for newly trained experts in HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, addiction, mental health, and many other conditions.The number 4,00,000 is impressive, but it’s not enough to meet the demand in India. There are many States, particularly rural ones, where we are gravely understaffed for the needs of our people. ECHO gives us the ability to reach healthcare workers in the most remote areas and afford them training comparable to what a healthcare worker in one of our largest cities would receive.Coronavirus | Private hospitals keen on taking up COVID-19 vaccinationThe fact is that India, led by the Serum Institute of India, has the largest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world. We need to plan smartly before COVID-19 vaccines become widely available. Who will deliver these vaccines? How do we store and handle the vaccines? How do we overcome cultural and religious barriers for those who are reluctant to accept a vaccine? How do we counsel people about side-effects so that they come to embrace the vaccine even if they start out with reservations? Knowing how to answer these questions requires cultivating real skills.And beyond vaccines, new treatments are on their way. As of last August, there were more than 20,000 peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19, and more than 100 are coming out every day. Who can make sense of this avalanche of knowledge? How will healthcare workers — many new to COVID — keep track of the most important information?Training more workers to treat more people is the best solution — for our personal and economic health. Simply put, we need more health experts to support vaccination and treatment. The ECHO model is worth ramping up even more to identify new healthcare workers who can be trained to be COVID-19 experts.Coronavirus | Government ensuring seamless last mile delivery of vaccines: VardhanAt the end of the day, our personal, community, and national health hinges on a trained and plentiful workforce that is constantly up to date with the right knowledge and skills to care for all of us. We now have the model for successfully addressing not only this pandemic but future ones. Let’s build on what we have accomplished so far.Dr. (Col.)

As a child, I would marvel at the fact that the ‘Boat Club’ on Rajpath, just a few hundred metres from Parliament, North and South Block, and Rashtrapati Bhavan, could be used by protesters of all political colours and hues. Protest marchers would begin at the Boat Club and walk to Gol Methi Chowk, just next to the Prime Minister’s residence. As a teenager one witnessed the tens of thousands of farmers led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union “occupy” the lawns from India Gate up to Vijay Chowk for a week in 1988, and then the Mandal anti-reservation agitation of 1990. Years later, it was the anti-corruption movement of 2011 and the protests against the gang-rape of a young woman in Delhi in 2012 that saw crowds overrun parts of “Lutyens’ Delhi”, as the area surrounding Parliament is known. In later years, protests in these areas were no longer allowed, and the government now restricts marches to a small strip of road near the Parliament Street Police Station, while larger protests like those against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the ongoing protests against the farm laws have been relegated to the outskirts of Delhi.During the Arab Spring, one covered protests in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad, and in Libya, against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi where police would take down details of those protesting and those covering the protests. However, “pro-regime” protesters were allowed to gather at will, threaten civilians, and even fire in the air. In Egypt, the second round of Tahrir Square protests in 2013 actually reversed the course of democracy, and installed another authoritarian government — that of former Military Intelligence Director Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.The point of rallying at the seat of power is simple: not only are the protesters ensuring that their voice is heard, as it should be in any democracy, they also believe that the buildings of power and the manicured lawns are public property and therefore lay claim on them as members of the public. As a journalist, you learn to quickly appreciate the power of protest when you are about to be trod underfoot in a crush of people. You are trained not to move towards the middle of the crowd, but to stay at its periphery, and move to a height on the side if possible. You are also given a first-hand look at the answer to important questions: when does a cry for justice turn into a movement to overturn a government, or even a coup? Also, when a government is elected by millions, can a crowd of less than a hundred thousand really represent a challenge to it? Finally, is a government more “in control” if it allows large protests to gather against it, or if it quells all protests so the protesters don’t have a chance of ‘Storming the Bastille’ as it were?The answers in my reporter’s notebook are simple: protest is a legitimate part of democracy, and when protestors fight to overturn a government action, or even to demand elections to overturn a government, they only strengthen that democracy. It is those that seek to overturn democracy as a system itself that are the worry: like the mobs on Capitol Hill who bore loyalty to one man over the democratic process, or those we have seen bringing authoritarian movements to power by overrunning democratically elected governments in different parts of the world. They do democracy its greatest disservice.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:03:10 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/rallying-at-the-seat-of-power/article33522747.ece\\n',\n",

The sheer viciousness of the January 6 mob attack, and more than two months of hateful vitriol online and offline following the 2020 election, is proof that political America is deeply polarised, brimming with anger and disenchantment at the ground realities. The “unprecedented assault” on the very soul of democracy (as Mr. Biden put it) has been in the making for more than four years. At the heart of the tsunami of angst that was evident throughout the election campaign is a sense of frustration that grips middle America, including the white middle class and blue-collar workers, over the inevitable changes to the U.S. economy and society. There is a view that the forces of immigration and globalisation have lit the fuses on this explosive combination of racial prejudice and economic insecurity. In reality, Mr. Trump’s strident rhetoric exploited this sense of alienation and socioeconomic dysfunction for narrow political and personal gains. Now Mr. Biden has an opportunity to strike a more balanced note by, on the one hand, seeking to revive the moribund spirit of bipartisan consensus and expediently tackling the thorny issue of comprehensive immigration reform, and, on the other, redressing the ills of runaway free-market liberalisation and forging a post-COVID-19 economic vision that can truly deliver on the American dream.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 2:58:42 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/fruits-of-incitement-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-trump-incited-mob-attack-on-us-capitol/article33523021.ece\\n',\n",

H5N1 and H5N8 were two of three subtypes found in Europe. Genetic analysis helped confirm the spread from Asia to west-central Europe, suggesting a “persistent circulation of this virus strain, likely in wild birds in Asia”. While avian influenza virus crossing the species barrier and directly infecting humans happens occasionally, human-to-human spread has been rare. But mutations or genetic reassortment of an avian influenza A virus and a human influenza A virus in a person can create a new influenza A virus that could likely result in sustained transmission between humans, thus increasing the risk of a pandemic influenza. Hence, all efforts should be directed at stamping out the outbreaks in the affected States. It is also important to undertake genome sequencing of virus samples to track the evolution of the virus.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:03:13 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/flu-in-full-flight-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-avian-flu-outbreak/article33523043.ece\\n',\n",

Ravi, former head of the Department of Neurovirology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), told The Hindu on Thursday.He said that only those who are in contact with the infected birds and health workers examining poultry workers are at risk. “This is not the first time that bird flu is being reported. We have been seeing this outbreak once every two years, but we have been able to tackle it early by culling birds,” he said.“During the current outbreak, the good thing is that we have a system in place. The COVID-19 precautions of SMS – Sanitisation, Masking and Social Distancing – that people are following is the best defence against all viruses,” Dr. Ravi said.The doctor, who is a member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the receptors of H5N1 are deep down in the lungs, unlike in H1N1 or COVID-19 where the virus can attach itself to a human being through the nasal cavity. “The human body has several defence barriers in the upper respiratory tract to check the virus. A person has to inhale high loads of the virus and that should go deep down into the respiratory tract to get infected,” he said.Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the State government has taken all measures to contain the outbreak. Samples sent“Six crows have died in Dakshina Kannada district. Their samples have been to the forensic lab for tests. Once the reports come, we will know if it is bird flu.

However, they say that doctors are not letting them know their new strain status. So far, 25 U.K. returnees have been admitted at TECC and 10 have been discharged.Prashant Agarwal, a 50-year-old patient who was discharged from TECC on Thursday, told The Hindu that he is still not aware of his new strain status. “There is so much hype about the new strain. Anyone returning from the U.K. is being treated as an alien. Although I have been in the hospital for 14 days, I have not been told if I have contracted the new strain, not even after discharge. Mine is not an isolated case,” he said.Stating that this has increased his stress and anxiety levels, Mr. Agarwal said it is the patient’s right to know the lab reports. “Whenever we asked for the genome sequencing report, doctors told us that NIMHANS would convey it to the Centre and from there it would come to the State and then to the hospital,” he said.“Although it does not make any difference whether my infection is the new strain or not, I wanted to know as I had tested RT-PCR negative before boarding from Atlanta, US. I transited through the UK and landed in Bengaluru on December 21 and must have contracted the infection enroute,” he said.Smitha Agarwal, his wife, alleged that her husband was not even given basic medicine for fever and cold till the fifth day in TECC. She had to send paracetamol and vitamin C tablets from home till the fifth day. “It was only after his oxygen level dropped that they started medication,” she alleged adding that the family was not even informed before discharge. Another patient, who was discharged two days ago, had a similar experience. Refusing to be named, he said he was not informed whether he was positive for the new strain or not. “Is it not my right as a patient to know about my reports?” Smitha Segu, nodal officer for COVID-19 at Victoria hospital, said only those who were positive for the new strain had been informed. Admitting that even those who are negative should have been informed, she said, “Their reports may not have come when they asked for the status.”Mother, child dischargedA 35-year-old woman and her 6-year-old daughter from Vasanthapura ward 197 in Bommanahalli zone, who tested positive for the UK strain of the COVID-19 virus on December 22, were discharged on Wednesday.

However, hospitals are back on their feet over the past few months.Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said: “During the peak of COVID-19, we had very few outpatient departments and elective surgeries. From physical OPDs, we moved to teleconsultations. Emergency services were always active. However, over the last four to five months, we have resumed all routine services. We are seeing around 300 to 500 outpatients a day now. “Non-COVID admissions have increased significantly,” he said. During the peak of pandemic, 80% admissions were patients with the viral infection. “Now, about 25% are COVID-19 admissions, and remaining are all non-COVID admissions. Teleconsultations have reduced while our walk-in OPD visits have gone up, as many patients prefer in-person consultation with doctors. Elective surgeries are regularly being performed. Earlier, among the daycare procedures, only dialysis was active besides emergency procedures. Now, we have dialysis, chemotherapy, endoscopy, radiological and cardiological interventional procedures being done regularly,” Dr. Gnanasekaran said. One of the indicators of normalcy was the rise in the number of people coming in for master health check-up. Among the transformations ushered in by COVID-19 were innovations such as remote monitoring of patients, healthcare digitisation and stringent clinical protocols, Dr. Gnanasekaran said.A medical director of another private hospital said all regular services were resumed a month ago and on an average, the hospital received 400 outpatients a day. “With good screening and isolation of COVID-19 patients, we have resumed services. The number of sick COVID-19 patients is down dramatically. Elective procedures have reached pre-COVID levels. The patient inflow for other services has improved like pre-COVID times,” he said.With normalcy returning, doctors are facing another challenge. “Many are presenting late. We see many patients with cancers of the head and neck — that is involving the larynx, throat and cheek — in an advanced stage. They knew they had a problem but did not seek help due to COVID-19. But in these conditions a few months is a long time,” said Mohan Kameswaran, managing director of Madras ENT Research Foundation.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:03:41 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/check-ups-resume-in-private-hospitals/article33523994.ece\\n',\n",

After leading the COVID-19 patient management since March, these hospitals have been witnessing a gradual rise in the turnout of patients for regular services in the past three months. But, this has not affected the COVID-19 services. Outpatient services and elective surgeries were stopped in a number of government hospitals when the pandemic was its peak. However, with the daily tally of fresh viral infections declining in the past few weeks, non-COVID services, especially elective procedures, were resumed, and are running full-fledged at present. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), 7,000 people turn up at the outpatient departments (OPDs) every day on an average. Prior to COVID-19, this figure was 10,000 to 15,000. The hospital has around 1,500 to 1,800 in-patients.“Now, all in-patient wards such as medicine, surgery, haematology, diabetology, rheumatology, orthopaedics, neurology and surgical gastroenterology are full. During the peak of the pandemic, we had 200 to 350 in-patients on an average. We are now performing nearly 50 elective surgeries a day and are preparing to resume organ transplant procedures,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said.In fact, hospitals have reduced the number of healthcare professionals posted on COVID-19 duty. “At present, all our COVID-19 services are concentrated in a single block — Tower 3. The maximum number of COVID-19 in-patients that we saw was 1,083. Today, we have 54 positive patients and 123 persons with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. We have reduced the number of doctors on COVID-19 duty from 243 to 90 for a cycle of six days,” he said.Procedures such as angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting resumed, while dialysis for both COVID-19 and regular patients continued, Dr. Theranirajan said. Reduction in COVID-19 duty did not mean a breather for the personnel, a government doctor said. “The number of patients coming for non-COVID services has increased. The work has only shifted to the routine,” she said. All emergency medical and surgical services continued throughout the COVID-19 period at the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital. “With regard to non-COVID-19 OP services, the numbers gradually increased from September at 1,250 a day to 4,500 a day at present. The non-COVID in-patient strength increased from 750 a day to 1,200 a day,” P. Balaji, dean of SMC, said. Elective surgeries were stopped in April, May and early June in a few speciality departments, they were being done in general surgery, orthopaedics and ENT sections based on the need although on a much lower scale. “As many patients were waiting for elective surgeries and most hospitals avoided them, we resumed in July itself. The number of elective surgeries done in all the specialities has been on the rise and has reached the pre-COVID levels,” he said.At the SMC, COVID-19 OPD and wards continued to function from a single block with separate entrance and exit. Along with COVID-19, the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital has been running regular services simultaneously as it caters to deliveries, treatment of burns and paediatric cases. As per data available with the hospital, 2,100 deliveries were recorded in October, November and December while 4,959 major and minor surgeries were performed on COVID-19 and other patients during the same period. “Prior to COVID-19, our OPD census was 3,500 to 4,500. Now, we are getting 2,500 to 3,000 outpatients. Our non-COVID in-patient strength is about 350 to 400. In fact, our bed occupancy has been 85% throughout as we have been getting many patients for deliveries, paediatric treatment and emergency,” P. Vasanthamani, dean of KMC, said. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:03:44 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hospitals-resume-regular-services-as-covid-19-daily-tally-dips/article33523970.ece\\n',\n",

They complained that the stretch falling under Pattaraiperumbudur toll plaza remained battered and posed a risk to motorists. People were put to hardship as the construction of two bridges at Pattaraiperumbudur and Narayanapuram was yet to be completed. Federation president S. Yuvaraj said the construction work at Pattaraiperumbudur had been put on hold for several months. This forced people travelling between Tiruttani and Tiruvallur to use the dilapidated old bridge. He wanted the work to be resumed early. “We have made a representation to the Tiruvallur district administration. The officials have assured us that the pothole-ridden portion of the road would be repaired in a month and the construction of the bridges would be resumed in March,” he said.The Federation had written to the Chairman of the National Highways Authority of India complaining about the poor maintenance of several stretches of roads such as Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway between Walajapet and Maduravoyal; Chennai-Tada Road; Ulundurpet-Salem; and Krishnagiri-Salem sections. Members alleged that incomplete roadwork caused accidents. About 500 accidents are reported every year at the Nazarathpet junction and on the Walajapet-Maduravoyal stretch of Chennai-Bengaluru NH. They complained that high toll was being collected although the road had not been widened to a six-lane. Members of the Building Equipment Owners’ Association and Construction and Real Estate Industry Coalition also participated in the protest. Srimathi Sadagopan, a resident of Pattabiram, said the road was poorly maintained and had many potholes. “It has been classified as a national highway but no development has happened in the last seven years. The NHAI should not be allowed to collect toll on that road. The Madras High Court is worried only about the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway and is following up on the road repairs on that stretch. Nobody bothers about this road or even questions how a two-lane road can be a national highway,” she said.  NHAI officials said a new concessionaire would be appointed for the 124 km Chennai-Tirupati Highway soon. “The repairs, if any, will be taken up by the new company. The need for a new concessionaire arose since the previous one did not maintain the road during the 2015-18 period. That company had not taken up widening of two bridges, work on which are now nearing completion,” the officials said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:03:56 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sand-lorry-owners-want-chennai-tirupati-road-repaired/article33523832.ece\\n',\n",

Khanna alone who has emphasised the importance of public hearing which is reflective of the democratic principles at the heart of our society. It is this principle which has been lacking in the Centre’s decision in going through with the colossal project, overlooking core issues such as health care, education and other basic needs. For the majority to say that they cannot control government spending amounts to a breach of public trust and going against constitutional mandates. The other surprise is the Supreme Court’s observation that it cannot heighten judicial review when it comes to the construction of the Central Vista and that it has to be judged by ordinary statutory procedures.The existing Parliament was the place where Independence was declared and is a heritage building.The Court would have been within its rights in directing the present Parliament to be put to better use rather than permitting a new building.

The Centre needs to take a clear stand on this issue and the Chief Minister will be writing to the Prime Minister. We appeal to all members of Parliament from the State to hold a meeting with the Prime Minister.”The previous State government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party had enacted a law to grant reservation to the community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes category. While the Bombay High Court cleared the quota law, the Supreme Court stayed it and the matter is pending before a larger Bench of the court. Hearing on the matter will begin on January 25 and the Centre will be presenting its stand on the issue.Mr. Chavan said, “The State government will be presenting its case strongly. But the Centre needs to take a positive stand too. The apex court had issued a notice to the Attorney General in the previous hearing. This is an opportunity for the Central government to make its stand clear.”Mr. Chavan said the Supreme Court should reconsider the existing 50% cap on reservations because if the Maratha quota comes into effect, the total reservation in the State will exceed 50%. He said, “Many State governments have already crossed this limit. Therefore, the landmark judgment in the 1993 Indira Sawhney case capping quotas at 50% needs a relook. This can happen if the Centre takes a positive stand on the issue.” Mr. Chavan pointed out that reservations in Tamil Nadu had exceeded 69% and the quota announced for the Economically Weaker Sections also crossed the limit. “None of it has been stayed, except for the Maratha reservation,” he said.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:04:07 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cm-to-urge-pm-to-take-positive-stand-on-maratha-quota/article33532402.ece\\n',\n",

Casting director and fitness trainer Munawwar Ali Sayyad, had filed the complaint referring to tweets and other statements from Ranaut and her sister.The police registered an FIR in October. They were booked under IPC sections, including 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 295-A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition).Ahead of her visit to the station, Ranaut put out a video on Twitter to say she was being targeted for expressing her opinion on issues related to the country\\'s welfare.\"My house was demolished illegally. When I talk about the welfare of the farmers there are cases being registered against me almost every day, for instance there is a case against me because I laughed,\" she claimed in the 1.30 minute video on Twitter.The video was titled, “Why am I being mentally, emotionally and now physically tortured? I need answers from this nation... I stood for you it\\'s time you stand for me”.She said there was a case against sister Rangoli for speaking up the attacks on doctors during the initial days of the coronavirus-induced lockdown.\"Even my name was added in that case even though I was not even on Twitter at the time. Usually, this does not happen, but it was done. And our Honourable Chief Justice rejected this saying this case does not make any sense.\" Ranaut said she did not know why she was ordered to mark her attendance at the police station.\"... and no one is telling me what kind of attendance is this? I have also been told that I can’t talk about the torture that I am being subjected to with anyone.\" The 33-year-old actor also brought in the Supreme Court of India in her video and ended with “Jai Hind”.Mumbai Police had sent notices against the sisters thrice, asking them to appear for recording their statements in the case.The Bombay High Court in November had granted interim protection from arrest to Kangana and her sister, and directed them to appear before the police on January 8.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:04:09 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kangana-reaches-bandra-police-station-to-record-statement-in-sedition-case/article33528144.ece\\n',\n",

Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing a plea filed by Meetu and Priyanka Singh seeking to quash the FIR filed on September 7 by the Bandra police station.They have been booked under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 464 (making a false document, 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 474 (having possession of document) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code along with provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Senior advocate Devadutt Kamat, appearing for Maharashtra, pointed to WhatsApp messages and said they revealed that Ms. Priyanka had prescribed medicines for the actor without online consultation. Hence it was a matter of investigation.Advocate Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Ms. Chakraborty, contended that she knew of Rajput taking medicines and narcotic substances. He said after Ms. Chakraborty got to know that the medicines were prescribed by a doctor who the actor never consulted, she filed the complaint.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing the sisters, argued there was no evidence against them and said the medicines referred to by Ms. Chakraborty could have been referred to by doctors through telemedicine as per the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines.CBI’s counsel Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh read the FIR and said as per the direction of the Supreme Court, the investigation into the FIR should have been transferred to the CBI by the Maharashtra government.The court then asked if the sisters had been arrested. Mr. Singh replied that there had not been any investigation in the matter so far. The Bench then observed: “From his face, one can make out that he was innocent and sober and a very good human being. Even in  MS Dhoni.

It said that over 5,800 redevelopment projects in Mumbai are lying in some degree of incompleteness and residents are rendered homeless. Informing Mr. Das about the decision taken by the Maharashtra government during his tenure as the Chief Minister, Mr. Fadnavis said, “The government had appointed the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank as the apex bank for the district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) and the cooperative credit structure in Maharashtra as the nodal agency for successful implementation of the self-redevelopment scheme in the State through DCCBs which also includes providing finance for the projects.” The BJP leader said that certain circulars from the RBI and the NABARD are tend to go against the objective of the scheme by treating these projects as commercial real estate projects. “There is apprehension that if the self-redevelopment scheme becomes dysfunctional, cooperative housing societies will be left entirely to the mercy of builders,” he said.Mr. Fadnavis urged the RBI governor to keep these projects out of the purview of the commercial real estate. “Members of cooperative housing societies are benefiting by way of getting additional carpet area and corpus due to the extra FSI benefit. This will also help boost the economy. The government will get sizeable revenue from the project as it is estimated that near about 30% to 40% of the project cost are part of the government revenue i.e. various premiums, taxes and duties etc.,” he added.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:04:14 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/housing-self-redevelopment-fadnavis-meets-rbi-governor/article33524384.ece\\n',\n",

Narayanasamy on Friday said the day-to-day interference by Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi is hampering the government’s development and welfare programmes.Inaugurating the day-and-night stir called by the Secular Democratic Alliance seeking the recall of Ms. Bedi, the Chief Minister said several of the programmes, including those in the election manifesto, could not be implemented due to the obstructions created by the Lt. Governor.Free rice could be distributed only for six months because of the insistence of the Lt. Governor to transfer money to the beneficiaries’ accounts. Even when the government agreed to procure rice from the Food Corporation of India at ₹28 per kg for distribution through Public Distribution System outlets, the Lt. Governor did not agree. The government proposal to procure rice from FCI was mooted after the Lt. Governor observed that buying rice from open market would lead to corruption, the Chief Minister said.  Women in villages prefer to obtain rice as the men in the families would take the money from banks and use it for “other” purposes. Sometimes, money transferred to the beneficiaries would not be sufficient because of price fluctuations in the market, he added.The Chief Minister also held the Lt. Governor responsible for the closure of textile mills and the delay in recruitment of police constabulary and clerical posts, as well as in getting funds. He also accused Ms. Bedi of not following the Cabinet’s order and subsequent directions of the Centre to delegate more financial powers to Cabinet members, Chief Secretary and Secretaries.“The intent of the protest is to seek removal of the Lt. Governor and for that the government is willing to sacrifice anything. The rights of people have been taken away and we will do everything to protect it,” he added. The Chief Minister also questioned the necessity of deployment of Central forces. The idea was to scare people away from the protest, he added. \\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:04:18 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/bedis-interference-hampered-govt-work/article33532409.ece\\n',\n",

Association president V. Bala Balasubramanian said even though the stated position of the government was that 50% reservation under the government quota would be implemented in three private medical colleges, it was unfortunate that when the case filed by a student was taken up for hearing by the Madras High Court, the government lawyers did not request for an early hearing.Whereas in the case filed by another student with the prayer to reserve 10% of seats for students of government schools, the government lawyers had sought an early hearing and judgment, and the case was posted for January 11.There are seven NRI seats and six other seats in the Government IGMC and around 42 NRI seats and six management quota seats in private medical colleges after the allotment in the second round of counselling.

Each centre conducted the test on 25 volunteers.“The second round of mock vaccination was tested out as the efficacy of immunisation requires repeating the dose after 28 days of the first jab is administered for immunity to develop,” Director of Health S. Mohan Kumar said.The first and second dry run exercises have been successfully completed in the Union Territory, he said.During the first round, the dry run had been held in nine centres in the Union Territory, including four in Puducherry, three in Karaikal and one each in Yanam and Mahe region.The two-stage dry run aimed at evaluating the logistical preparedness, including cold chain networks and plug gaps between intent and implementation. The drive also helps to test the robustness of the CoWIN, a data management platform, set up for the vaccination drive.A text message is sent out to targeted beneficiaries to report to a designated location with details of the vaccinator and the expected time of immunisation. Once they are given dummy vaccines, a report is generated to the Task Force for review before submission to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.On Thursday, the Health Ministry had held a video conference to assess the preparedness of the Union Territory, ahead of the second dry run.Chief Minister V Narayanasamy had said recently that the first batch of vials were expected to be made available by the Centre to Puducherry in the next few days.

A burst of thunder followed by lightning lit up the room. The passage was empty. She heard footsteps but she could see no one. Her drawers and cupboard were flung open noisily. She whimpered. Strangely, she felt the glare of icy-cold eyes on her. She crawled deeper into her blanket, not daring to breathe.

Albert, the general factotum, was putting everything back in place.All morning, it rained. They sat indoors and read, thinking it was a sad end to their holiday.

Mishti whined loudly and hid between Moti uncle’s legs.“The storm is frightening Mishti,” said Dhruv, walking out. He found the open window in the study and leant out to get hold of the catch. He felt something cold and clammy on his back. He let out a sharp cry and felt it slithering off. He shuddered and, turning around, caught a glimpse of a dark, black shape scurrying away. He shut the window and looked around. The room was in shambles. It looked like someone was conducting a thorough search.Dhruv went back to the drawing room and said, “The study is a mess. Everything is lying around…as if someone’s searching for something…”“Was the window catch broken?” asked Keya.“No…” he replied and hesitated.“What happened?” asked Keya. “Just that I had a strange sensation when I leant out to shut the window…it was as if something cold and slimy touched me.

At the district level, District Collectors spearheaded COVID-19 management activities.Mr. Khan said that the State ensured adequate testing facilities in all districts along with the private sector including COVID-19 STEP (Screening, Testing, Education and Prevention) kiosks at public places.DISHA helplines and psycho social support network was established in all districts to help COVID patients and those under quarantine to overcome stress and other psychological issues.The Government established COVID-19 first-line and second-line treatment centres to offer treatment support to COVID patients and a COVID brigade was established to enlist support of voluntary groups and individuals to overcome the human resources challenges faced by the Health Department.Post-COVID care and management was attended to through special clinics set up at periphery and referral clinics at the secondary level. The elderly and those with chronic diseases were cared for through the work of health workers, ASHAs and anganwadi workers. Community kitchens were started across the State for distribution of food to patients, those in quarantine and isolation, and other needy people.The Governor made special mention of the roles played by the Revenue, Local Self Government, and the Police Departments during the pandemic to support the Health Department by taking care of all activities outside the health sector.Mr. Khan detailed the special socio-economic and welfare measures, including the welfare pensions and the ₹20,000 crore economic package implemented by the Government.Free ration worth ₹300 crore was distributed to all families affected by COVID-19 pandemic.

Several aspirants, some even from Kollam, turned up for the process as early as 8 a.m.Amid lack of measures to streamline crowds, the attendees jostled each other as they rushed to find seats in the hall as they flouted physical distancing norms. While the venue could barely accommodate 1,500 people, extra chairs were brought in for those who had to stand long hours in the sun outside the hall.In a bid to decongest the area, the university authorities deferred the spot allotment process for BSc courses to the afternoon. However, almost all of those who had come from faraway places chose to stick around.With the situation threatening to go out of hand, the university authorities abruptly brought the process to a halt by noon. The aspirants who managed to obtain allotments by then were provided assurances that their admissions remained intact. Vice Chancellor V.P. Mahadevan Pillai later issued directions to conduct the spot allotments in more number of centres to adhere to the COVID-19 norms.Many students rued the university’s decision to conduct spot admissions to affiliated colleges in a centralised manner this year.

The proposed legislation came at a time when the growers were grappling with unseasonal rains and COVID-19 casting its shadow on the market.The bill drafted to curb smoking was ‘draconian’ in nature at a time when the country already had stringent regulations which aided illegal tobacco trade, said Tobacco Board vice-chairman G. Konda Reddy. The proposed legislation aimed at increasing the smokers age from 18 to 21 years, ban sale of free cigarettes, get rid of smoking rooms in airports and eateries and enhance penalties for flouting public smoking guidelines.Voicing their concern over regulatory overreach, Southern Black Soil Farmers’ Welfare Association president Pothula Narasimha Rao said India was now a safe haven for illicit tobacco trade. The country was fourth largest illicit market for cigarettes in the world and the menace went unchecked. The proposed legislation would only aggravate the illicit cigarette trade controlled by unsocial elements. It would adversely affect, among others, farmers and farm workers in the drought-prone district as they grew tobacco, a drought-resistant crop without any viable economic alternative, opined Ongole II Tobacco Farmers’ Welfare Association secretary V.V.Prasad. The Centre should focus on curbing illegal cigarette trade comprising international smuggled and locally manufactured tax-evaded cigarettes which accounted over 25% of domestically manufactured cigarettes, they said. According to an estimate by the tobacco industry, the government lost more than ₹15,000 crore per year on account of illegal tobacco trade.

Senior forest officials said though the poaching activity was under check, of late the bustle had raised its ugly head and the reason is “high demand for bushmeat in Bengaluru”.Giving credence to the suspicion among the forest officials is the increasing incidence of poachers arranging snares to hunt wild boars and deer. A few days ago, a sloth bear died after being caught in the snare arranged by poachers in the reserve forest near Palamaner. Last week, the Rallabuduguru police in Kuppam circle arrested a man and confiscated a country rifle from him, after he had accidentally shot at a 14-year-old boy, while hunting wild boars. Similarly, on January 4, the forest officials arrested an accused and seized a country rifle and some meat of sambhar at Bhakarapeta in Seshachalam ranges. Small-time poachers are reportedly making a fast buck by supplying bushmeat, preferably of wild boar, rabbit, spotted deer and fowl, to their clients in Bengaluru. Owing to COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for bushmeat, believed to be rich with protein and having medicinal values, has increased. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu that there was some yet-to-be verified information with the department that there was a very big demand for bushmeat in Bengaluru, “which might have prompted recent spurt in hunting the small game.” The official said it was possible that those involved in poaching might be cashing in on the demand. The DFO said that to put an end to poaching, a special drive had been planned. “We want to cover all the forest fringe villages and the hamlets in the forest enclosures and urge prople to cooperate with the forest department to preserve the flora and fauna. As a first step, we will ask those in possession of illegal firearms to surrender them to the area police and forest officers. Our next step will be to file criminal cases under Wildlife Protection Act,” Mr. Ravi Shankar added.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:05:04 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/poaching-on-the-rise-as-demand-for-bushmeat-soars-in-bengaluru/article33525711.ece\\n',\n",

The idea is to provide double-lane connectivity from the district headquarters to the mandal headquarters and their adjoining ones. Widening of roads in a stretch of 3,104 kms, and construction and reconstruction of 479 bridges have also been proposed to be undertaken as part of the projects.  “Administrative sanction for ₹2,978 crore has been given for the first phase of works pertaining to improvement of roads in a stretch of 1,243 kms. Tenders have been invited after judicial preview. Through reverse tendering, a sum of ₹85.43 crore was saved in the first phase of works,” said the Minister. The Letters of Authorisation have been issued for all 13 packages and the first phase of works would be grounded in February, he said, adding that preparation of DPRs for the second phase of works were nearing completion. As per the guidelines, the State government has to complete the tendering process for at least 30 % of the project cost before entering into loan agreements with the NDB. The Roads and Buildings Department has completed the tendering process for the first phase, representing works to the tune of 45% of the project cost.The State government, the Centre and the NDB signed loan agreements for the projects on Wednesday.

Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.“So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.”Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, is also concerning.The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the U.K. andSouth African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new variants,particularly the one that emerged in South Africa.Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa “has a number additional mutations” that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc., which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.\\nPrintable version | Jul 26, 2021 3:05:21 PM | https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pfizer-and-biontech-vaccine-appears-effective-against-mutation-in-new-coronavirus-variants-study/article33526846.ece\\n']"
